# 🚀 SEO & Content Strategy: No Dig Canada

Target Region: **Vancouver, Surrey, Burnaby, Richmond, Coquitlam, and the Lower Mainland, BC.**

## 1. Keyword Architecture
We will organize keywords into "Clusters" to dominate both broad and specific searches.

### Cluster A: The "Core" (High Competition)
*Target: Main Homepage*
*   Primary: "Trenchless Sewer Repair Vancouver"
*   Secondary: "CIPP Pipelining BC", "No-Dig Pipe Repair"

### Cluster B: Location-Specific (Local SEO)
*Target: Dedicated Service Areas Pages*
*   "Sewer Lining Surrey" | "Pipe Repair Coquitlam" | "Drain Cleaning Richmond"
*   **Strategy:** Create 5-7 pages, each with unique text and local landmarks mentioned to rank in those specific Google Maps areas.

### Cluster C: Specialized Services (The "Edge")
*Target: Service Sub-pages*
*   "Manhole Rehabilitation Vancouver"
*   "Catch Basin Cleaning Lower Mainland"
*   "Industrial Pipe Descaling BC"

## 2. Technical SEO Requirements
Using findings from **Awesome SEO**, our site must include:
*   **JSON-LD Schema Markup:** This tells Google exactly what services you offer and where. (I will implement this in the `index.html`).
*   **Core Web Vitals:** Ultra-fast loading speeds. (We will use high-efficiency CSS and optimized images).
*   **Mobile-First Design:** 70% of local service searches happen on phones.

## 3. Content Strategy (The "Trust Builder")
*   **"Disruption-Free" Messaging:** Every page must lead with the fact that no excavation is required.
*   **The Process Page:** A step-by-step guide (with icons) on how CIPP works. Most customers are nervous about tech they don't understand. 
*   **Client Project Highlights:** A "live" feed of recent fixes in specific cities (e.g., "Just fixed a root intrusion in a Langley backyard!").

## 4. Competitive "Gap" Strategy
*   **Vortex & NuFlow** focus on the technical/industrial side.
*   **Trifecta & Super Plumber** focus on the "friendly neighborhood plumber" side.
*   **No Dig Canada's Opportunity:** Position as the **Advanced Technical Specialist** who is also **Local and Accessible**. (The "High-Tech Neighbor").
