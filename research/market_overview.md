## 💡 Strategic Insights for No Dig Canada
1. **The "No-Dig" Brand:** Your name is your biggest SEO asset. "No Dig" is a high-volume search term. We should double down on this in headers (H1/H2).
2. **Local Authority:** Unlike national brands, you can win by creating **Location Pages** (e.g., "Pipe Repair in Coquitlam", "Sewer Lining in Surrey").
3. **Service Diversification:** Since you do **Manhole Repairs**, you have a unique edge over standard residential plumbers. We should create a dedicated "Municipal/Industrial" section to separate this from residential "Drain Cleaning."
4. **Visual Proof:** Competitors are using "minimal disruption" as a slogan. We need "Before/After" photos that specifically show a beautiful yard *after* a major pipe repair.
