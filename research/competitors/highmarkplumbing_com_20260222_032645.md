Excellent service from Highmark. Our Plummer Dane was a rockstar with proposing options within our budget then quickly and efficiently performing the work. Excellent service replacing our garborator and repairing a leaking toilet. We were super impressed with how quickly the whole service took from our first call to the office to all our plumbing issues fixed in less than a day. Highly recommend and would trust with any size plumbing project.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

We experienced a sewage backup in our home just after Christmas and they responded quickly to our call. Morgan clearly explained everything that was required and all repairs (including a couple of unrelated issues) were completed within a few days - he works fast and efficiently. Inquiries with the after hours service and manager Scott were very professional and handled quickly. I highly recommend this company.

Introduced by Alpha Mecanic, I called them yesterday to schedule a repair for my heating system. The receptionist was very polite and helpful, immediately informing me of the appointment for 8:00 AM on January 7th. Today, the technician Mr.Brant arrived, on time and explained the work percedule, he started to work on the systems,after numerous tests, determined the problem was a motor failure requiring replacement. He immediately provided a quote, which I found very reasonable. The technician's professionalism convinced us of his assessment, leading to a quick decision. I didn't want to waste time comparing with other contractors a professional, trustworthy, and reliable repair company is crucial, and the reasonable price was also very impressive.

They were ready to come right away but then the property manager finally gets back to me and they are going Fox (warranty) and they won't be here til wed. If this company works as well as the lady I talked to on the phone then I cant give enough stars! She was awesome. Please use this company!!!

Thank you High Mark Plumbing for your responsive and thorough help - during the winter holidays no less. From my initial call to Kat, while I was stressed about my townhouse appliances (a few things broke down within a two week span); emails with Kat and Scott B, to help me with Strata-required documentation and schedule the assessment & install; visit, assessment, and quote from Morgan F who presented multiple options - HWT with/without expander, additional warranty, etc. - and helped me understand the longer term picture (and why other band-aid solutions - that he didn't recommend, but neighbours were trying to convince me to do - wouldn't be wise financially nor structurally); and finally the installation itself, with Billy M, who quietly & efficiently installed the Hot Water Tank & Expander, respectfully moving throughout my house (without judgement of its state of mess). I can now get back to the comfort and ease of having hot water running through my home, without worry that it'll shut off (or worse) for many years. Paying for peace of mind is worth the unexpected cost during the holidays, thank you.

We recently had a new gas furnace installed and our roof venting converted to run out the front of the house, and the whole experience was excellent. Brent and Martin did an outstanding job on the install. Initially we thought we were going to have no choice but exposed piping across our laundry room ceiling, but much to our delight they took the time to run everything encased in the wall. Kevin handled the initial inspection and also came by quickly when a fuse blew, which we really appreciated. He tweaked some settings and we've had no issues since. Everyone went above and beyond, and the work was done incredibly well. We even got a new thermostat installed by them which was also unexpected and extremely welcome. We’re very happy with the results and feel confident we’re in good hands.

Impressive customer service and technician.....I discoverd a gutter spout over flowing at the ground level drain during heavy rain. I contacted High Mark due to their positive reviews. The contact person was helpful and professional .The specialist plumber arrived on time the next day. Dane was patient and encouraged me to explain the issue, history and other whole house potential issues.Dane scoped the drain tile with his high tech camera. Dane displayed the blockage to me. A lower portion of the down spout that fed into the drainage system had broken off and then blocked all the leaves etc. causing the block.Dane removed the metal down spout detached metal portion and the water flowed freely.Dane was very impressive in his experience and an overall friendly guy.

Ryan came by and fixed 3 toilets that we were having issues with. He was workmanlike and professional in his demeanor. Our female cat who doesn't normally like people actually let him pet her! One of the toilets was not getting water for some reason and he fixed that too. I am pleased with his service.------------prior visit ----------------Tassos did a great job. He explained everything he was doing and his logic behind it. Although we were unable to reproduce the leak, he did show pictures of where water stains had occurred and these were all above the drain. We think that the source of the leak was from leaky shower attachment which then caused a stream of water to run towards the shower/tub control. Since he had previously reapplied silicone to that control, we were unable to reproduce the leak.

After trying to diagnose the leak myself, unsuccessfully obviously, I needed to call High Mark Plumbing for their help. Tassos arrived with a smile and was very friendly and thoughtful. Always ensuring to put on his inside booties when entering the house. He took the time to explain in detail and answering my questions when it came to the investigation and diagnosis of the problem. All options were explored and discussed. Tassos very much included me in the process and at no time did I not know what was happening. He was very cognizant to minimize the amount debris during the repair and was also cognizant to cleanup as he went along. If you get Tassos as your guy, rest assured you’re in good hands. 👍🏼👍🏼

Andrew is very diligent and trustworthy. After my heat pump stopped working within the year of installation, he spent at least 2 days sorting out the problem and fixing it. I highly recommend him.

Dane H, from Highmark, was very professional and efficient. He tackled the problem at stake in a responsible manner.He then presented me with choices, and left behind his recommendations - very helpful for the long term plumbing health of my household. I was nicely impressed. Thank you.

Excellent service from Highmark. Our Plummer Dane was a rockstar with proposing options within our budget then quickly and efficiently performing the work. Excellent service replacing our garborator and repairing a leaking toilet. We were super impressed with how quickly the whole service took from our first call to the office to all our plumbing issues fixed in less than a day. Highly recommend and would trust with any size plumbing project.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

So pleased with their quick response time, knowledgeable technicians and wonderful customer service. We experienced a sewage backup in our home just after Christmas and they responded quickly to our call. Morgan clearly explained everything that was required and all repairs (including a couple of unrelated issues) were completed within a few days - he works fast and efficiently. Inquiries with the after hours service and manager Scott were very professional and handled quickly. I highly recommend this company.

Introduced by Alpha Mecanic, I called them yesterday to schedule a repair for my heating system. The receptionist was very polite and helpful, immediately informing me of the appointment for 8:00 AM on January 7th. Today, the technician Mr.Brant arrived, on time and explained the work percedule, he started to work on the systems,after numerous tests, determined the problem was a motor failure requiring replacement. He immediately provided a quote, which I found very reasonable. The technician's professionalism convinced us of his assessment, leading to a quick decision. I didn't want to waste time comparing with other contractors a professional, trustworthy, and reliable repair company is crucial, and the reasonable price was also very impressive.

Our furnace is making loud noises. We rent but couldn't get a hold of the property manager so called these people. They were ready to come right away but then the property manager finally gets back to me and they are going Fox (warranty) and they won't be here til wed. If this company works as well as the lady I talked to on the phone then I cant give enough stars! She was awesome. Please use this company!!! Unfortunately I had to cancel and wait til this other company shows up.

Thank you High Mark Plumbing for your responsive and thorough help - during the winter holidays no less. From my initial call to Kat, while I was stressed about my townhouse appliances (a few things broke down within a two week span); emails with Kat and Scott B, to help me with Strata-required documentation and schedule the assessment & install; visit, assessment, and quote from Morgan F who presented multiple options - HWT with/without expander, additional warranty, etc. - and helped me understand the longer term picture (and why other band-aid solutions - that he didn't recommend, but neighbours were trying to convince me to do - wouldn't be wise financially nor structurally); and finally the installation itself, with Billy M, who quietly & efficiently installed the Hot Water Tank & Expander, respectfully moving throughout my house (without judgement of its state of mess). I can now get back to the comfort and ease of having hot water running through my home, without worry that it'll shut off (or worse) for many years. Paying for peace of mind is worth the unexpected cost during the holidays, thank you.

Well it started with a kitchen sink leak and ended up with us wondering about creating a new outdoor hot/cold faucet to was the dog. Morgan was on time with a plan and exceeded our expectations by completing multiple plumbing upgrades in one day. When the job was done there was no mess to deal with and we were very satisfied with the service. I highly recommend Highmark and will definitely use them again.

We recently had a new gas furnace installed and our roof venting converted to run out the front of the house, and the whole experience was excellent. Brent and Martin did an outstanding job on the install. Initially we thought we were going to have no choice but exposed piping across our laundry room ceiling, but much to our delight they took the time to run everything encased in the wall. Kevin handled the initial inspection and also came by quickly when a fuse blew, which we really appreciated. He tweaked some settings and we've had no issues since. Everyone went above and beyond, and the work was done incredibly well. We even got a new thermostat installed by them which was also unexpected and extremely welcome. We’re very happy with the results and feel confident we’re in good hands.

I wanted to update this review as we use High Mark for a lot of services...from their family to ours.Billy M. recently replaced a hot water tank for my elderly parents. They were extremely happy with his work, his ethic and his professionalism.We have also had Bamanye come in to our home to replace our leaky kitchen faucet. Quick, efficient, and friendly. As we come to expect from the High Mark name.Ryan B has come in the past to help clear a clog and was also fast, efficient and friendly.High Mark has a lot to offer from electrical services to plumbing and mechanical. I feel great knowing we have a whole service team behind us and the employees are really top notch.

Impressive customer service and technician.....I discoverd a gutter spout over flowing at the ground level drain during heavy rain. I contacted High Mark due to their positive reviews. The contact person was helpful and professional .The specialist plumber arrived on time the next day. Dane was patient and encouraged me to explain the issue, history and other whole house potential issues.Dane scoped the drain tile with his high tech camera. Dane displayed the blockage to me. A lower portion of the down spout that fed into the drainage system had broken off and then blocked all the leaves etc. causing the block.Dane removed the metal down spout detached metal portion and the water flowed freely.Dane was very impressive in his experience and an overall friendly guy.

Morgan was great! He came out on short notice last week and capped off our gas line and installed our new stove, installed a new garburator and fixed an issue with our ensuite bathtub. He was polite, efficient and fair in what he charged, we highly recommend his services! You won't be disappointed! Thanks again Morgan!

Emailed and got a quick response. Morgan was able to provide an assessment, quote, and start work right away. I had previous work done by another company and had some questions about it that Morgan was able to answer and provide his own suggestions moving forward, which I greatly appreciated, really eased some concerns I had. Great work on the job I had done. Thank you! Will be coming back for future work.

Great experience with High Mark Plumbing and Heating. Morgan came to check a possible hot water tank issue and was knowledgeable, patient, and thorough. He replaced the water pressure regulator to prevent future problems and provided suggestions on ways to improve water and energy efficiency.

The High Mark team was able to come out to my house within about 30 minutes of when I called. I had a relatively simple issue with my kitchen sink that I personally couldn’t fix and they were able to resolve it in 15 minutes at no cost beyond the site visit fee.They also provided me a very reasonable quote for a hot water tank replacement since mine is a bit more than 10 years old. Thanks!

We discovered a serious issue with our hot water tank and contacted High Mark first thing in the morning. They immediately sent a technician for inspection, who confirmed that the tank needed to be replaced. Impressively, they provided a new unit and completed the replacement within half a day. I’m very satisfied with both their prompt service and the quality of their work.

First time using High Mark Plumbing and Heating this long weekend. Hot water tank issue. My call was answered promptly on a Sunday long weekend morning and the gal put me thru to a fellow who was able to talk me through to shut the water off and shut down the hot water tank completely. And within an hour Kevin arrived to save the day. He was prompt, explained everything clearly, answered any questions I had as well. Within a few hours I had a new hot water tank. I would call this company again. Thank you, Kevin/Highmark Plumbing & Heating

Dane, the service expert at my job, was super friendly, was keen to explain the issue, tell me exactly what he was going to do, and then taught me how to do it for myself in the future. Great plumbing experience.. probably not the cheapest, but piece of mind and super easy to deal with, great communication. Will call again (but hopefully not soon!)

Ryan came by and fixed 3 toilets that we were having issues with. He was workmanlike and professional in his demeanor. Our female cat who doesn't normally like people actually let him pet her! One of the toilets was not getting water for some reason and he fixed that too. I am pleased with his service.------------prior visit ----------------Tassos did a great job. He explained everything he was doing and his logic behind it. Although we were unable to reproduce the leak, he did show pictures of where water stains had occurred and these were all above the drain. We think that the source of the leak was from leaky shower attachment which then caused a stream of water to run towards the shower/tub control. Since he had previously reapplied silicone to that control, we were unable to reproduce the leak.

After trying to diagnose the leak myself, unsuccessfully obviously, I needed to call High Mark Plumbing for their help. Tassos arrived with a smile and was very friendly and thoughtful. Always ensuring to put on his inside booties when entering the house. He took the time to explain in detail and answering my questions when it came to the investigation and diagnosis of the problem. All options were explored and discussed. Tassos very much included me in the process and at no time did I not know what was happening. He was very cognizant to minimize the amount debris during the repair and was also cognizant to cleanup as he went along. If you get Tassos as your guy, rest assured you’re in good hands. 👍🏼👍🏼

Excellent service from Highmark. Our Plummer Dane was a rockstar with proposing options within our budget then quickly and efficiently performing the work. Excellent service replacing our garborator and repairing a leaking toilet. We were super impressed with how quickly the whole service took from our first call to the office to all our plumbing issues fixed in less than a day. Highly recommend and would trust with any size plumbing project.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

So pleased with their quick response time, knowledgeable technicians and wonderful customer service. We experienced a sewage backup in our home just after Christmas and they responded quickly to our call. Morgan clearly explained everything that was required and all repairs (including a couple of unrelated issues) were completed within a few days - he works fast and efficiently. Inquiries with the after hours service and manager Scott were very professional and handled quickly. I highly recommend this company.

Introduced by Alpha Mecanic, I called them yesterday to schedule a repair for my heating system. The receptionist was very polite and helpful, immediately informing me of the appointment for 8:00 AM on January 7th. Today, the technician Mr.Brant arrived, on time and explained the work percedule, he started to work on the systems,after numerous tests, determined the problem was a motor failure requiring replacement. He immediately provided a quote, which I found very reasonable. The technician's professionalism convinced us of his assessment, leading to a quick decision. I didn't want to waste time comparing with other contractors a professional, trustworthy, and reliable repair company is crucial, and the reasonable price was also very impressive.

They were ready to come right away but then the property manager finally gets back to me and they are going Fox (warranty) and they won't be here til wed. If this company works as well as the lady I talked to on the phone then I cant give enough stars! She was awesome. Please use this company!!!

Thank you High Mark Plumbing for your responsive and thorough help - during the winter holidays no less. From my initial call to Kat, while I was stressed about my townhouse appliances (a few things broke down within a two week span); emails with Kat and Scott B, to help me with Strata-required documentation and schedule the assessment & install; visit, assessment, and quote from Morgan F who presented multiple options - HWT with/without expander, additional warranty, etc. - and helped me understand the longer term picture (and why other band-aid solutions - that he didn't recommend, but neighbours were trying to convince me to do - wouldn't be wise financially nor structurally); and finally the installation itself, with Billy M, who quietly & efficiently installed the Hot Water Tank & Expander, respectfully moving throughout my house (without judgement of its state of mess). I can now get back to the comfort and ease of having hot water running through my home, without worry that it'll shut off (or worse) for many years. Paying for peace of mind is worth the unexpected cost during the holidays, thank you.

We recently had a new gas furnace installed and our roof venting converted to run out the front of the house, and the whole experience was excellent. Brent and Martin did an outstanding job on the install. Initially we thought we were going to have no choice but exposed piping across our laundry room ceiling, but much to our delight they took the time to run everything encased in the wall. Kevin handled the initial inspection and also came by quickly when a fuse blew, which we really appreciated. He tweaked some settings and we've had no issues since. Everyone went above and beyond, and the work was done incredibly well. We even got a new thermostat installed by them which was also unexpected and extremely welcome. We’re very happy with the results and feel confident we’re in good hands.

Impressive customer service and technician.....I discoverd a gutter spout over flowing at the ground level drain during heavy rain. I contacted High Mark due to their positive reviews. The contact person was helpful and professional .The specialist plumber arrived on time the next day. Dane was patient and encouraged me to explain the issue, history and other whole house potential issues.Dane scoped the drain tile with his high tech camera. Dane displayed the blockage to me. A lower portion of the down spout that fed into the drainage system had broken off and then blocked all the leaves etc. causing the block.Dane removed the metal down spout detached metal portion and the water flowed freely.Dane was very impressive in his experience and an overall friendly guy.

Ryan came by and fixed 3 toilets that we were having issues with. He was workmanlike and professional in his demeanor. Our female cat who doesn't normally like people actually let him pet her! One of the toilets was not getting water for some reason and he fixed that too. I am pleased with his service.------------prior visit ----------------Tassos did a great job. He explained everything he was doing and his logic behind it. Although we were unable to reproduce the leak, he did show pictures of where water stains had occurred and these were all above the drain. We think that the source of the leak was from leaky shower attachment which then caused a stream of water to run towards the shower/tub control. Since he had previously reapplied silicone to that control, we were unable to reproduce the leak.

Always ensuring to put on his inside booties when entering the house. He took the time to explain in detail and answering my questions when it came to the investigation and diagnosis of the problem. All options were explored and discussed. Tassos very much included me in the process and at no time did I not know what was happening. He was very cognizant to minimize the amount debris during the repair and was also cognizant to cleanup as he went along. If you get Tassos as your guy, rest assured you’re in good hands. 👍🏼👍🏼

We were super impressed with how quickly the whole service took from our first call to the office to all our plumbing issues fixed in less than a day. Highly recommend and would trust with any size plumbing project.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

So pleased with their quick response time, knowledgeable technicians and wonderful customer service. We experienced a sewage backup in our home just after Christmas and they responded quickly to our call. Morgan clearly explained everything that was required and all repairs (including a couple of unrelated issues) were completed within a few days – he works fast and efficiently. Inquiries with the after hours service and manager Scott were very professional and handled quickly. I highly recommend this company.

Introduced by Alpha Mecanic, I called them yesterday to schedule a repair for my heating system. The receptionist was very polite and helpful, immediately informing me of the appointment for 8:00 AM on January 7th. Today, the technician Mr.Brant arrived, on time and explained the work percedule, he started to work on the systems,after numerous tests, determined the problem was a motor failure requiring replacement. He immediately provided a quote, which I found very reasonable. The technician’s professionalism convinced us of his assessment, leading to a quick decision. I didn’t want to waste time comparing with other contractors a professional, trustworthy, and reliable repair company is crucial, and the reasonable price was also very impressive.

They were ready to come right away but then the property manager finally gets back to me and they are going Fox (warranty) and they won’t be here til wed. If this company works as well as the lady I talked to on the phone then I cant give enough stars! She was awesome. Please use this company!!!

Thank you High Mark Plumbing for your responsive and thorough help – during the winter holidays no less. From my initial call to Kat, while I was stressed about my townhouse appliances (a few things broke down within a two week span); emails with Kat and Scott B, to help me with Strata-required documentation and schedule the assessment & install; visit, assessment, and quote from Morgan F who presented multiple options – HWT with/without expander, additional warranty, etc. – and helped me understand the longer term picture (and why other band-aid solutions – that he didn’t recommend, but neighbours were trying to convince me to do – wouldn’t be wise financially nor structurally); and finally the installation itself, with Billy M, who quietly & efficiently installed the Hot Water Tank & Expander, respectfully moving throughout my house (without judgement of its state of mess). I can now get back to the comfort and ease of having hot water running through my home, without worry that it’ll shut off (or worse) for many years. Paying for peace of mind is worth the unexpected cost during the holidays, thank you.

We recently had a new gas furnace installed and our roof venting converted to run out the front of the house, and the whole experience was excellent. Brent and Martin did an outstanding job on the install. Initially we thought we were going to have no choice but exposed piping across our laundry room ceiling, but much to our delight they took the time to run everything encased in the wall. Kevin handled the initial inspection and also came by quickly when a fuse blew, which we really appreciated. He tweaked some settings and we’ve had no issues since. Everyone went above and beyond, and the work was done incredibly well. We even got a new thermostat installed by them which was also unexpected and extremely welcome. We’re very happy with the results and feel confident we’re in good hands.

Impressive customer service and technician…..I discoverd a gutter spout over flowing at the ground level drain during heavy rain. I contacted High Mark due to their positive reviews. The contact person was helpful and professional .The specialist plumber arrived on time the next day. Dane was patient and encouraged me to explain the issue, history and other whole house potential issues.Dane scoped the drain tile with his high tech camera. Dane displayed the blockage to me. A lower portion of the down spout that fed into the drainage system had broken off and then blocked all the leaves etc. causing the block.Dane removed the metal down spout detached metal portion and the water flowed freely.Dane was very impressive in his experience and an overall friendly guy.

Ryan came by and fixed 3 toilets that we were having issues with. He was workmanlike and professional in his demeanor. Our female cat who doesn’t normally like people actually let him pet her! One of the toilets was not getting water for some reason and he fixed that too. I am pleased with his service.————prior visit —————-Tassos did a great job. He explained everything he was doing and his logic behind it. Although we were unable to reproduce the leak, he did show pictures of where water stains had occurred and these were all above the drain. We think that the source of the leak was from leaky shower attachment which then caused a stream of water to run towards the shower/tub control. Since he had previously reapplied silicone to that control, we were unable to reproduce the leak.

They were ready to come right away but then the property manager finally gets back to me and they are going Fox (warranty) and they won’t be here til wed. If this company works as well as the lady I talked to on the phone then I cant give enough stars! She was awesome. Please use this company!!! Unfortunately I had to cancel and wait til this other company shows up.

Thank you High Mark Plumbing for your responsive and thorough help – during the winter holidays no less. From my initial call to Kat, while I was stressed about my townhouse appliances (a few things broke down within a two week span); emails with Kat and Scott B, to help me with Strata-required documentation and schedule the assessment & install; visit, assessment, and quote from Morgan F who presented multiple options – HWT with/without expander, additional warranty, etc. – and helped me understand the longer term picture (and why other band-aid solutions – that he didn’t recommend, but neighbours were trying to convince me to do – wouldn’t be wise financially nor structurally); and finally the installation itself, with Billy M, who quietly & efficiently installed the Hot Water Tank & Expander, respectfully moving throughout my house (without judgement of its state of mess). I can now get back to the comfort and ease of having hot water running through my home, without worry that it’ll shut off (or worse) for many years. Paying for peace of mind is worth the unexpected cost during the holidays, thank you.

Morgan was on time with a plan and exceeded our expectations by completing multiple plumbing upgrades in one day. When the job was done there was no mess to deal with and we were very satisfied with the service. I highly recommend Highmark and will definitely use them again.

We recently had a new gas furnace installed and our roof venting converted to run out the front of the house, and the whole experience was excellent. Brent and Martin did an outstanding job on the install. Initially we thought we were going to have no choice but exposed piping across our laundry room ceiling, but much to our delight they took the time to run everything encased in the wall. Kevin handled the initial inspection and also came by quickly when a fuse blew, which we really appreciated. He tweaked some settings and we’ve had no issues since. Everyone went above and beyond, and the work was done incredibly well. We even got a new thermostat installed by them which was also unexpected and extremely welcome. We’re very happy with the results and feel confident we’re in good hands.

They were extremely happy with his work, his ethic and his professionalism.We have also had Bamanye come in to our home to replace our leaky kitchen faucet. Quick, efficient, and friendly. As we come to expect from the High Mark name.Ryan B has come in the past to help clear a clog and was also fast, efficient and friendly.High Mark has a lot to offer from electrical services to plumbing and mechanical. I feel great knowing we have a whole service team behind us and the employees are really top notch.

Impressive customer service and technician…..I discoverd a gutter spout over flowing at the ground level drain during heavy rain. I contacted High Mark due to their positive reviews. The contact person was helpful and professional .The specialist plumber arrived on time the next day. Dane was patient and encouraged me to explain the issue, history and other whole house potential issues.Dane scoped the drain tile with his high tech camera. Dane displayed the blockage to me. A lower portion of the down spout that fed into the drainage system had broken off and then blocked all the leaves etc. causing the block.Dane removed the metal down spout detached metal portion and the water flowed freely.Dane was very impressive in his experience and an overall friendly guy.

Ryan came by and fixed 3 toilets that we were having issues with. He was workmanlike and professional in his demeanor. Our female cat who doesn’t normally like people actually let him pet her! One of the toilets was not getting water for some reason and he fixed that too. I am pleased with his service.————prior visit —————-Tassos did a great job. He explained everything he was doing and his logic behind it. Although we were unable to reproduce the leak, he did show pictures of where water stains had occurred and these were all above the drain. We think that the source of the leak was from leaky shower attachment which then caused a stream of water to run towards the shower/tub control. Since he had previously reapplied silicone to that control, we were unable to reproduce the leak.

Horrible service from this company will never use them. Came out to investigate a leak gave me an extremely high estimate and when I couldn’t afford to do the work that day, he left the holes in my drywall & instead of putting the drywall back & so I ended up with mice in my kitchen. Never had mice before.Be very careful with these plumbers you pay for the visit ensure that they close any area that open up in your walls.

Excellent service from Highmark. Our Plummer Dane was a rockstar with proposing options within our budget then quickly and efficiently performing the work. Excellent service replacing our garborator and repairing a leaking toilet. We were super impressed with how quickly the whole service took from our first call to the office to all our plumbing issues fixed in less than a day. Highly recommend and would trust with any size plumbing project.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

While the tech they sent was great the price was ridiculous. Had them out to replace 2 bathroom taps and quote showed 440.00. Turns out it was 440.00 for each tap. With their dispatch fee and tap replacement cost is was over 1,100.00 for about 2 1/2 hours. Part my fault I didn’t question it but I was super busy with other work. Triple check their pricing

Decided to go with 2 stars since I never got the service from them. We recently purchased a new place and the home inspector recommended High Mark to service the system. I called to book an appointment and they never showed, stating that their reps were busy at other sites. Booked a different day and the same thing happened. I decided to go with another company rather than wait another week. I cleared my schedule twice for High Mark and did not get the service, very unfortunate. I went with 2 stars since I can’t speak for their actual service work.

SENIORS ALERTMy senior step dad called Highmark plumbing for a simple plumbing fix. Billy M showed up, took a quick look at the problem, quoted $450, smooth talking him the whole time, giving the hard sell and left, job done, in less than an hour!I got wind of the price and called Highmark to discuss the exorbitant price but have not heard back from anyone. Please don’t get yourself ripped off by this company!!!!!! There are plenty of fair and respectful plumbers out there, Highmark is not one of them.

So pleased with their quick response time, knowledgeable technicians and wonderful customer service. We experienced a sewage backup in our home just after Christmas and they responded quickly to our call. Morgan clearly explained everything that was required and all repairs (including a couple of unrelated issues) were completed within a few days – he works fast and efficiently. Inquiries with the after hours service and manager Scott were very professional and handled quickly. I highly recommend this company.

Introduced by Alpha Mecanic, I called them yesterday to schedule a repair for my heating system. The receptionist was very polite and helpful, immediately informing me of the appointment for 8:00 AM on January 7th. Today, the technician Mr.Brant arrived, on time and explained the work percedule, he started to work on the systems,after numerous tests, determined the problem was a motor failure requiring replacement. He immediately provided a quote, which I found very reasonable. The technician’s professionalism convinced us of his assessment, leading to a quick decision. I didn’t want to waste time comparing with other contractors a professional, trustworthy, and reliable repair company is crucial, and the reasonable price was also very impressive.

They were ready to come right away but then the property manager finally gets back to me and they are going Fox (warranty) and they won’t be here til wed. If this company works as well as the lady I talked to on the phone then I cant give enough stars! She was awesome. Please use this company!!!

\*\*SCAMMER\*\*Unfortunately I won’t be using this company anymore. I’ve gone through them a couple of times for heating issues and they were great…once I had to deal with a plumber though things changed. I just finished a kitchen reno and I just needed to reconnect the old pvc piping underneath the sink with a little extension. Its an easy install, all the parts were here already, but I just didn’t have the time. He quoted us almost $900 dollars, which is pure insanity. I dont know if it was because he was dealing with my wife at first and thought he could pull one over on her. After that got balked at he lowered it to $400, which goes to show how much he was trying to rip us off from the get-go. I told him I wouldn’t be using this company again, and I would be reporting him, which I did. I’m still blown away by what this guy tried to pull on us and makes me wonder what’s happening to other customers. This is my warning to anyone looking for plumbers. Keep moving.

Thank you High Mark Plumbing for your responsive and thorough help – during the winter holidays no less. From my initial call to Kat, while I was stressed about my townhouse appliances (a few things broke down within a two week span); emails with Kat and Scott B, to help me with Strata-required documentation and schedule the assessment & install; visit, assessment, and quote from Morgan F who presented multiple options – HWT with/without expander, additional warranty, etc. – and helped me understand the longer term picture (and why other band-aid solutions – that he didn’t recommend, but neighbours were trying to convince me to do – wouldn’t be wise financially nor structurally); and finally the installation itself, with Billy M, who quietly & efficiently installed the Hot Water Tank & Expander, respectfully moving throughout my house (without judgement of its state of mess). I can now get back to the comfort and ease of having hot water running through my home, without worry that it’ll shut off (or worse) for many years. Paying for peace of mind is worth the unexpected cost during the holidays, thank you.

We recently had a new gas furnace installed and our roof venting converted to run out the front of the house, and the whole experience was excellent. Brent and Martin did an outstanding job on the install. Initially we thought we were going to have no choice but exposed piping across our laundry room ceiling, but much to our delight they took the time to run everything encased in the wall. Kevin handled the initial inspection and also came by quickly when a fuse blew, which we really appreciated. He tweaked some settings and we’ve had no issues since. Everyone went above and beyond, and the work was done incredibly well. We even got a new thermostat installed by them which was also unexpected and extremely welcome. We’re very happy with the results and feel confident we’re in good hands.

Impressive customer service and technician…..I discoverd a gutter spout over flowing at the ground level drain during heavy rain. I contacted High Mark due to their positive reviews. The contact person was helpful and professional .The specialist plumber arrived on time the next day. Dane was patient and encouraged me to explain the issue, history and other whole house potential issues.Dane scoped the drain tile with his high tech camera. Dane displayed the blockage to me. A lower portion of the down spout that fed into the drainage system had broken off and then blocked all the leaves etc. causing the block.Dane removed the metal down spout detached metal portion and the water flowed freely.Dane was very impressive in his experience and an overall friendly guy.

I’ve previously used High Mark For their plumbing services and since I had plumbing issues again, I decided to contact them again since I was quite happy with the job well done.Recently I’ve noticed a stain on my ceiling and called for help detecting where this leak was coming from. Someone from high mark came in, looked at the location of the stain and saw it was below the toilet, where he wanted to verify by cutting my ceiling more and flushing so that he and my sister can physically see the leak from the toilet. When the toilet was flushed several times, there were no signs of leaks. The worker was insistent that he was 100% sure the leak was coming from the toilet even though they saw nothing with their eyes. So I paid $600 for a man to come into my home, cut a hole on the ceiling, to not find the source of leak and basically said trust me bro? Mind you, he wrote out the quoted amount of $600 to cut the ceiling AND investigate where the leak is coming from. IF the leak was found, I would have no problem paying. Absolutely nothing was done. Now there’s a hole in the ceiling. No toilet was moved to double check. Nothing was accomplished. And here I am paying $600 for what exactly? Super frustrating.Edit: to add, it was the bathtub.

Dane did a couple of the jobs and I was grateful for his assessments. I was kept informed of arrival times and there was always a follow up call. Thank you, High Mark!!!

First time using High Mark Plumbing and Heating this long weekend. Hot water tank issue. My call was answered promptly on a Sunday long weekend morning and the gal put me thru to a fellow who was able to talk me through to shut the water off and shut down the hot water tank completely. And within an hour Kevin arrived to save the day. He was prompt, explained everything clearly, answered any questions I had as well. Within a few hours I had a new hot water tank. I would call this company again. Thank you, Kevin/Highmark Plumbing & Heating

Morgan stopped by this morning and helped install our 2 brand new toilets. We had been struggling with the install due to previous DIY mistakes from the old owners of the house, and were worried we might do more damage trying to work around it. We’re grateful to finally have them in, and know it was done the right way.

Do not use this company I called to get my toilet repaired basically changing the seal, they sent a guy called Dane, he told me in order to change it he will charge me 425 plus 150 dispatch fee, if he ll change the seal only it ll be 380 plus dispatch fee. When I told him only 45 dollars difference, he said he has to make some money for the company. I told him I prepared the other toilet for only 300 total, he said he can’t do it. When I refused his service he still charged dispatch fee. I called the company to complain, no one called me back. It took them 4 hours to send me the invoice. I called around to get it fixed, guess what it’s 190 total plus parts. This company is not honest, and money grabbers. I meant to send this 2 weeks ago, the manager called me right away and got the situation rectified. Thanks Scott

I called yesterday to request someone come in and look at our on demand hot water heater which was acting up. Booking the appointment was easy, and the customer service representatives were great.The technician arrived right on time first thing the next morning, and took a look at our system. After his assessment, he determined that the problem was likely the check valve, and that the ignition switch was going to need replacement in the near future so could be done at the same time (also we needed a new gear clamp for the exhaust at the top of the unit).I decided not to proceed with the work, as the quote provided was simply a number ($968 plus gst) on the page, with no explanation for where that number came from. He explained that it covered the issues listed above, but couldn’t tell me the breakdown. The technician reiterated that they are a flat rate company and that it’s a flat rate for labour and materials. “It’s just the flat rate”, he said. That made me uncomfortable and that gut feeling was what ultimately made me decline the service.As recommended by the tech, I will be proceeding instead with “an hourly company” who provides a breakdown of exactly what the costs will be for the work.In summary – happy with the responsiveness and punctuality of the customer service team and technician, but was very uncomfortable with the vagueness of the quote.UPDATE: I went with a different company who ultimately came in $300 under the highmark quote, explained where all the costs were calculated from, AND did more work. Not only did the other company fix the ignition, the check valve, and tighten the gear clamp, but they also did a full heat exchange flush. High mark’s rating has now lost a star due to severely overquoting me for the work. I will not be recommending high mark, nor will I be calling them for any future work.

Ryan came by and fixed 3 toilets that we were having issues with. He was workmanlike and professional in his demeanor. Our female cat who doesn’t normally like people actually let him pet her! One of the toilets was not getting water for some reason and he fixed that too. I am pleased with his service.————prior visit —————-Tassos did a great job. He explained everything he was doing and his logic behind it. Although we were unable to reproduce the leak, he did show pictures of where water stains had occurred and these were all above the drain. We think that the source of the leak was from leaky shower attachment which then caused a stream of water to run towards the shower/tub control. Since he had previously reapplied silicone to that control, we were unable to reproduce the leak.

I brought them in to service my furnace and they pointed out that my hot water tank needed to be replaced. They were very pushy and aggressive in their sales pitch using needless scare techniques. They also overcharged the job by double (I got estimates from others that confirmed this). Their follow up afterwards was terrible and found their customer service well below what you would expect given the amount that was spent. I would stay away from them as there are much better options out there that do not actively work on ripping off their customers.

Always ensuring to put on his inside booties when entering the house. He took the time to explain in detail and answering my questions when it came to the investigation and diagnosis of the problem. All options were explored and discussed. Tassos very much included me in the process and at no time did I not know what was happening. He was very cognizant to minimize the amount debris during the repair and was also cognizant to cleanup as he went along. If you get Tassos as your guy, rest assured you’re in good hands. 👍🏼👍🏼

Horrible service from this company will never use them. Came out to investigate a leak gave me an extremely high estimate and when I couldn’t afford to do the work that day, he left the holes in my drywall & instead of putting the drywall back & so I ended up with mice in my kitchen. Never had mice before.Be very careful with these plumbers you pay for the visit ensure that they close any area that open up in your walls.

While the tech they sent was great the price was ridiculous. Had them out to replace 2 bathroom taps and quote showed 440.00. Turns out it was 440.00 for each tap. With their dispatch fee and tap replacement cost is was over 1,100.00 for about 2 1/2 hours. Part my fault I didn’t question it but I was super busy with other work. Triple check their pricing

Decided to go with 2 stars since I never got the service from them. We recently purchased a new place and the home inspector recommended High Mark to service the system. I called to book an appointment and they never showed, stating that their reps were busy at other sites. Booked a different day and the same thing happened. I decided to go with another company rather than wait another week. I cleared my schedule twice for High Mark and did not get the service, very unfortunate. I went with 2 stars since I can’t speak for their actual service work.

SENIORS ALERTMy senior step dad called Highmark plumbing for a simple plumbing fix. Billy M showed up, took a quick look at the problem, quoted $450, smooth talking him the whole time, giving the hard sell and left, job done, in less than an hour!I got wind of the price and called Highmark to discuss the exorbitant price but have not heard back from anyone. Please don’t get yourself ripped off by this company!!!!!! There are plenty of fair and respectful plumbers out there, Highmark is not one of them.

We experienced a sewage backup in our home just after Christmas and they responded quickly to our call.

Inquiries with the after hours service and manager Scott were very professional and handled quickly. I highly recommend this company.

Introduced by Alpha Mecanic, I called them yesterday to schedule a repair for my heating system. The receptionist was very polite and helpful, immediately informing me of the appointment for 8:00 AM on January 7th. Today, the technician Mr.Brant arrived, on time and explained the work percedule, he started to work on the systems,after numerous tests, determined the problem was a motor failure requiring replacement. He immediately provided a quote, which I found very reasonable. The technician’s professionalism convinced us of his assessment, leading to a quick decision. I didn’t want to waste time comparing with other contractors a professional, trustworthy, and reliable repair company is crucial, and the reasonable price was also very impressive.

\*\*SCAMMER\*\*Unfortunately I won’t be using this company anymore. I’ve gone through them a couple of times for heating issues and they were great…once I had to deal with a plumber though things changed. I just finished a kitchen reno and I just needed to reconnect the old pvc piping underneath the sink with a little extension. Its an easy install, all the parts were here already, but I just didn’t have the time. He quoted us almost $900 dollars, which is pure insanity. I dont know if it was because he was dealing with my wife at first and thought he could pull one over on her. After that got balked at he lowered it to $400, which goes to show how much he was trying to rip us off from the get-go. I told him I wouldn’t be using this company again, and I would be reporting him, which I did. I’m still blown away by what this guy tried to pull on us and makes me wonder what’s happening to other customers. This is my warning to anyone looking for plumbers. Keep moving.

Thank you High Mark Plumbing for your responsive and thorough help – during the winter holidays no less. From my initial call to Kat, while I was stressed about my townhouse appliances (a few things broke down within a two week span); emails with Kat and Scott B, to help me with Strata-required documentation and schedule the assessment & install; visit, assessment, and quote from Morgan F who presented multiple options – HWT with/without expander, additional warranty, etc. – and helped me understand the longer term picture (and why other band-aid solutions – that he didn’t recommend, but neighbours were trying to convince me to do – wouldn’t be wise financially nor structurally); and finally the installation itself, with Billy M, who quietly & efficiently installed the Hot Water Tank & Expander, respectfully moving throughout my house (without judgement of its state of mess). I can now get back to the comfort and ease of having hot water running through my home, without worry that it’ll shut off (or worse) for many years. Paying for peace of mind is worth the unexpected cost during the holidays, thank you.

We recently had a new gas furnace installed and our roof venting converted to run out the front of the house, and the whole experience was excellent. Brent and Martin did an outstanding job on the install. Initially we thought we were going to have no choice but exposed piping across our laundry room ceiling, but much to our delight they took the time to run everything encased in the wall. Kevin handled the initial inspection and also came by quickly when a fuse blew, which we really appreciated. He tweaked some settings and we’ve had no issues since. Everyone went above and beyond, and the work was done incredibly well. We even got a new thermostat installed by them which was also unexpected and extremely welcome. We’re very happy with the results and feel confident we’re in good hands.

Impressive customer service and technician…..I discoverd a gutter spout over flowing at the ground level drain during heavy rain. I contacted High Mark due to their positive reviews. The contact person was helpful and professional .The specialist plumber arrived on time the next day. Dane was patient and encouraged me to explain the issue, history and other whole house potential issues.Dane scoped the drain tile with his high tech camera. Dane displayed the blockage to me. A lower portion of the down spout that fed into the drainage system had broken off and then blocked all the leaves etc. causing the block.Dane removed the metal down spout detached metal portion and the water flowed freely.Dane was very impressive in his experience and an overall friendly guy.

I’ve previously used High Mark For their plumbing services and since I had plumbing issues again, I decided to contact them again since I was quite happy with the job well done.Recently I’ve noticed a stain on my ceiling and called for help detecting where this leak was coming from. Someone from high mark came in, looked at the location of the stain and saw it was below the toilet, where he wanted to verify by cutting my ceiling more and flushing so that he and my sister can physically see the leak from the toilet. When the toilet was flushed several times, there were no signs of leaks. The worker was insistent that he was 100% sure the leak was coming from the toilet even though they saw nothing with their eyes. So I paid $600 for a man to come into my home, cut a hole on the ceiling, to not find the source of leak and basically said trust me bro? Mind you, he wrote out the quoted amount of $600 to cut the ceiling AND investigate where the leak is coming from. IF the leak was found, I would have no problem paying. Absolutely nothing was done. Now there’s a hole in the ceiling. No toilet was moved to double check. Nothing was accomplished. And here I am paying $600 for what exactly? Super frustrating.Edit: to add, it was the bathtub.

Do not use this company I called to get my toilet repaired basically changing the seal, they sent a guy called Dane, he told me in order to change it he will charge me 425 plus 150 dispatch fee, if he ll change the seal only it ll be 380 plus dispatch fee. When I told him only 45 dollars difference, he said he has to make some money for the company. I told him I prepared the other toilet for only 300 total, he said he can’t do it. When I refused his service he still charged dispatch fee. I called the company to complain, no one called me back. It took them 4 hours to send me the invoice. I called around to get it fixed, guess what it’s 190 total plus parts. This company is not honest, and money grabbers. I meant to send this 2 weeks ago, the manager called me right away and got the situation rectified. Thanks Scott

I called yesterday to request someone come in and look at our on demand hot water heater which was acting up. Booking the appointment was easy, and the customer service representatives were great.The technician arrived right on time first thing the next morning, and took a look at our system. After his assessment, he determined that the problem was likely the check valve, and that the ignition switch was going to need replacement in the near future so could be done at the same time (also we needed a new gear clamp for the exhaust at the top of the unit).I decided not to proceed with the work, as the quote provided was simply a number ($968 plus gst) on the page, with no explanation for where that number came from. He explained that it covered the issues listed above, but couldn’t tell me the breakdown. The technician reiterated that they are a flat rate company and that it’s a flat rate for labour and materials. “It’s just the flat rate”, he said. That made me uncomfortable and that gut feeling was what ultimately made me decline the service.As recommended by the tech, I will be proceeding instead with “an hourly company” who provides a breakdown of exactly what the costs will be for the work.In summary – happy with the responsiveness and punctuality of the customer service team and technician, but was very uncomfortable with the vagueness of the quote.UPDATE: I went with a different company who ultimately came in $300 under the highmark quote, explained where all the costs were calculated from, AND did more work. Not only did the other company fix the ignition, the check valve, and tighten the gear clamp, but they also did a full heat exchange flush. High mark’s rating has now lost a star due to severely overquoting me for the work. I will not be recommending high mark, nor will I be calling them for any future work.

Highmark plumbing was super easy and friendly to deal with. Arrived when they said they would. Dane, the service expert at my job, was super friendly, was keen to explain the issue, tell me exactly what he was going to do, and then taught me how to do it for myself in the future. Great plumbing experience.. probably not the cheapest, but piece of mind and super easy to deal with, great communication. Will call again (but hopefully not soon!)

Ryan came by and fixed 3 toilets that we were having issues with. He was workmanlike and professional in his demeanor. Our female cat who doesn’t normally like people actually let him pet her! One of the toilets was not getting water for some reason and he fixed that too. I am pleased with his service.————prior visit —————-Tassos did a great job. He explained everything he was doing and his logic behind it. Although we were unable to reproduce the leak, he did show pictures of where water stains had occurred and these were all above the drain. We think that the source of the leak was from leaky shower attachment which then caused a stream of water to run towards the shower/tub control. Since he had previously reapplied silicone to that control, we were unable to reproduce the leak.

I brought them in to service my furnace and they pointed out that my hot water tank needed to be replaced. They were very pushy and aggressive in their sales pitch using needless scare techniques. They also overcharged the job by double (I got estimates from others that confirmed this). Their follow up afterwards was terrible and found their customer service well below what you would expect given the amount that was spent. I would stay away from them as there are much better options out there that do not actively work on ripping off their customers.

After trying to diagnose the leak myself, unsuccessfully obviously, I needed to call High Mark Plumbing for their help. Tassos arrived with a smile and was very friendly and thoughtful. Always ensuring to put on his inside booties when entering the house. He took the time to explain in detail and answering my questions when it came to the investigation and diagnosis of the problem. All options were explored and discussed. Tassos very much included me in the process and at no time did I not know what was happening. He was very cognizant to minimize the amount debris during the repair and was also cognizant to cleanup as he went along. If you get Tassos as your guy, rest assured you’re in good hands. 👍🏼👍🏼

Introduced by Alpha Mecanic, I called them yesterday to schedule a repair for my heating system. The receptionist was very polite and helpful, immediately informing me of the appointment for 8:00 AM on January 7th. Today, the technician Mr.Brant arrived, on time and explained the work percedule, he started to work on the systems,after numerous tests, determined the problem was a motor failure requiring replacement. He immediately provided a quote, which I found very reasonable. The technician's professionalism convinced us of his assessment, leading to a quick decision. I didn't want to waste time comparing with other contractors a professional, trustworthy, and reliable repair company is crucial, and the reasonable price was also very impressive.

Thank you High Mark Plumbing for your responsive and thorough help - during the winter holidays no less. From my initial call to Kat, while I was stressed about my townhouse appliances (a few things broke down within a two week span); emails with Kat and Scott B, to help me with Strata-required documentation and schedule the assessment & install; visit, assessment, and quote from Morgan F who presented multiple options - HWT with/without expander, additional warranty, etc. - and helped me understand the longer term picture (and why other band-aid solutions - that he didn't recommend, but neighbours were trying to convince me to do - wouldn't be wise financially nor structurally); and finally the installation itself, with Billy M, who quietly & efficiently installed the Hot Water Tank & Expander, respectfully moving throughout my house (without judgement of its state of mess). I can now get back to the comfort and ease of having hot water running through my home, without worry that it'll shut off (or worse) for many years. Paying for peace of mind is worth the unexpected cost during the holidays, thank you.

We recently had a new gas furnace installed and our roof venting converted to run out the front of the house, and the whole experience was excellent. Brent and Martin did an outstanding job on the install. Initially we thought we were going to have no choice but exposed piping across our laundry room ceiling, but much to our delight they took the time to run everything encased in the wall. Kevin handled the initial inspection and also came by quickly when a fuse blew, which we really appreciated. He tweaked some settings and we've had no issues since. Everyone went above and beyond, and the work was done incredibly well. We even got a new thermostat installed by them which was also unexpected and extremely welcome. We’re very happy with the results and feel confident we’re in good hands.

Impressive customer service and technician.....I discoverd a gutter spout over flowing at the ground level drain during heavy rain. I contacted High Mark due to their positive reviews. The contact person was helpful and professional .The specialist plumber arrived on time the next day. Dane was patient and encouraged me to explain the issue, history and other whole house potential issues.Dane scoped the drain tile with his high tech camera. Dane displayed the blockage to me. A lower portion of the down spout that fed into the drainage system had broken off and then blocked all the leaves etc. causing the block.Dane removed the metal down spout detached metal portion and the water flowed freely.Dane was very impressive in his experience and an overall friendly guy.

Morgan was great! He came out on short notice last week and capped off our gas line and installed our new stove, installed a new garburator and fixed an issue with our ensuite bathtub. He was polite, efficient and fair in what he charged, we highly recommend his services! You won't be disappointed! Thanks again Morgan!

Emailed and got a quick response. Morgan was able to provide an assessment, quote, and start work right away. I had previous work done by another company and had some questions about it that Morgan was able to answer and provide his own suggestions moving forward, which I greatly appreciated, really eased some concerns I had. Great work on the job I had done. Thank you! Will be coming back for future work.

The High Mark team was able to come out to my house within about 30 minutes of when I called. I had a relatively simple issue with my kitchen sink that I personally couldn’t fix and they were able to resolve it in 15 minutes at no cost beyond the site visit fee.They also provided me a very reasonable quote for a hot water tank replacement since mine is a bit more than 10 years old. Thanks!

We discovered a serious issue with our hot water tank and contacted High Mark first thing in the morning. They immediately sent a technician for inspection, who confirmed that the tank needed to be replaced. Impressively, they provided a new unit and completed the replacement within half a day. I’m very satisfied with both their prompt service and the quality of their work.

My call was answered promptly on a Sunday long weekend morning and the gal put me thru to a fellow who was able to talk me through to shut the water off and shut down the hot water tank completely. And within an hour Kevin arrived to save the day. He was prompt, explained everything clearly, answered any questions I had as well. Within a few hours I had a new hot water tank. I would call this company again. Thank you, Kevin/Highmark Plumbing & Heating

Ryan came by and fixed 3 toilets that we were having issues with. He was workmanlike and professional in his demeanor. Our female cat who doesn't normally like people actually let him pet her! One of the toilets was not getting water for some reason and he fixed that too. I am pleased with his service.------------prior visit ----------------Tassos did a great job. He explained everything he was doing and his logic behind it. Although we were unable to reproduce the leak, he did show pictures of where water stains had occurred and these were all above the drain. We think that the source of the leak was from leaky shower attachment which then caused a stream of water to run towards the shower/tub control. Since he had previously reapplied silicone to that control, we were unable to reproduce the leak.

After trying to diagnose the leak myself, unsuccessfully obviously, I needed to call High Mark Plumbing for their help. Tassos arrived with a smile and was very friendly and thoughtful. Always ensuring to put on his inside booties when entering the house. He took the time to explain in detail and answering my questions when it came to the investigation and diagnosis of the problem. All options were explored and discussed. Tassos very much included me in the process and at no time did I not know what was happening. He was very cognizant to minimize the amount debris during the repair and was also cognizant to cleanup as he went along. If you get Tassos as your guy, rest assured you’re in good hands. 👍🏼👍🏼

Introduced by Alpha Mecanic, I called them yesterday to schedule a repair for my heating system. The receptionist was very polite and helpful, immediately informing me of the appointment for 8:00 AM on January 7th. Today, the technician Mr.Brant arrived, on time and explained the work percedule, he started to work on the systems,after numerous tests, determined the problem was a motor failure requiring replacement. He immediately provided a quote, which I found very reasonable. The technician's professionalism convinced us of his assessment, leading to a quick decision. I didn't want to waste time comparing with other contractors a professional, trustworthy, and reliable repair company is crucial, and the reasonable price was also very impressive.

Thank you High Mark Plumbing for your responsive and thorough help - during the winter holidays no less. From my initial call to Kat, while I was stressed about my townhouse appliances (a few things broke down within a two week span); emails with Kat and Scott B, to help me with Strata-required documentation and schedule the assessment & install; visit, assessment, and quote from Morgan F who presented multiple options - HWT with/without expander, additional warranty, etc. - and helped me understand the longer term picture (and why other band-aid solutions - that he didn't recommend, but neighbours were trying to convince me to do - wouldn't be wise financially nor structurally); and finally the installation itself, with Billy M, who quietly & efficiently installed the Hot Water Tank & Expander, respectfully moving throughout my house (without judgement of its state of mess). I can now get back to the comfort and ease of having hot water running through my home, without worry that it'll shut off (or worse) for many years. Paying for peace of mind is worth the unexpected cost during the holidays, thank you.

We recently had a new gas furnace installed and our roof venting converted to run out the front of the house, and the whole experience was excellent. Brent and Martin did an outstanding job on the install. Initially we thought we were going to have no choice but exposed piping across our laundry room ceiling, but much to our delight they took the time to run everything encased in the wall. Kevin handled the initial inspection and also came by quickly when a fuse blew, which we really appreciated. He tweaked some settings and we've had no issues since. Everyone went above and beyond, and the work was done incredibly well. We even got a new thermostat installed by them which was also unexpected and extremely welcome. We’re very happy with the results and feel confident we’re in good hands.

A lower portion of the down spout that fed into the drainage system had broken off and then blocked all the leaves etc. causing the block.Dane removed the metal down spout detached metal portion and the water flowed freely.Dane was very impressive in his experience and an overall friendly guy.

Morgan was great! He came out on short notice last week and capped off our gas line and installed our new stove, installed a new garburator and fixed an issue with our ensuite bathtub. He was polite, efficient and fair in what he charged, we highly recommend his services! You won't be disappointed! Thanks again Morgan!

Emailed and got a quick response. Morgan was able to provide an assessment, quote, and start work right away. I had previous work done by another company and had some questions about it that Morgan was able to answer and provide his own suggestions moving forward, which I greatly appreciated, really eased some concerns I had. Great work on the job I had done. Thank you! Will be coming back for future work.

The High Mark team was able to come out to my house within about 30 minutes of when I called. I had a relatively simple issue with my kitchen sink that I personally couldn’t fix and they were able to resolve it in 15 minutes at no cost beyond the site visit fee.They also provided me a very reasonable quote for a hot water tank replacement since mine is a bit more than 10 years old. Thanks!

We discovered a serious issue with our hot water tank and contacted High Mark first thing in the morning.

And within an hour Kevin arrived to save the day. He was prompt, explained everything clearly, answered any questions I had as well. Within a few hours I had a new hot water tank.

Ryan came by and fixed 3 toilets that we were having issues with. He was workmanlike and professional in his demeanor. Our female cat who doesn't normally like people actually let him pet her! One of the toilets was not getting water for some reason and he fixed that too. I am pleased with his service.------------prior visit ----------------Tassos did a great job. He explained everything he was doing and his logic behind it. Although we were unable to reproduce the leak, he did show pictures of where water stains had occurred and these were all above the drain. We think that the source of the leak was from leaky shower attachment which then caused a stream of water to run towards the shower/tub control. Since he had previously reapplied silicone to that control, we were unable to reproduce the leak.

## Warning Signs that Indicate a Plumbing Emergency

Plumbing problems can show early, silent signs before turning into an emergency. Look out for these signs to catch the problem before they get worse:

- **Unpleasant Odours:** Foul odours from your drains typically happen from clogs and sewer line problems.
- **Spike in Water Meter or Bills:** Regularly check your water bills and take action when a notice from the city arrives I the mail. This can help uncover hidden problems in your plumbing systems.
- **Gurgling and Bubbling Sounds:** This often signals sewer line problems which tends to be a severe clog deeper down the line.
- **Specific Lush Areas in Your Landscaping:** Lush spots indicate possible leak in your watermain, sewer line, or drain tile giving extra hydration and fertilizer to the soil.
- **Mold, Mildew, and Pest Problems:** When there’s moisture and humidity lingering in the walls and crawlspaces, you may find unwelcome pests in your home, often indicating a leak or burst pipe.

Dane H, from Highmark, was very professional and efficient. He tackled the problem at stake in a responsible manner.He then presented me with choices, and left behind his recommendations - very helpful for the long term plumbing health of my household. I was nicely impressed. Thank you.

Excellent service from Highmark. Our Plummer Dane was a rockstar with proposing options within our budget then quickly and efficiently performing the work. Excellent service replacing our garborator and repairing a leaking toilet. We were super impressed with how quickly the whole service took from our first call to the office to all our plumbing issues fixed in less than a day. Highly recommend and would trust with any size plumbing project.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

So pleased with their quick response time, knowledgeable technicians and wonderful customer service. We experienced a sewage backup in our home just after Christmas and they responded quickly to our call. Morgan clearly explained everything that was required and all repairs (including a couple of unrelated issues) were completed within a few days - he works fast and efficiently. Inquiries with the after hours service and manager Scott were very professional and handled quickly. I highly recommend this company.

Introduced by Alpha Mecanic, I called them yesterday to schedule a repair for my heating system. The receptionist was very polite and helpful, immediately informing me of the appointment for 8:00 AM on January 7th. Today, the technician Mr.Brant arrived, on time and explained the work percedule, he started to work on the systems,after numerous tests, determined the problem was a motor failure requiring replacement. He immediately provided a quote, which I found very reasonable. The technician's professionalism convinced us of his assessment, leading to a quick decision. I didn't want to waste time comparing with other contractors a professional, trustworthy, and reliable repair company is crucial, and the reasonable price was also very impressive.

Our furnace is making loud noises. We rent but couldn't get a hold of the property manager so called these people. They were ready to come right away but then the property manager finally gets back to me and they are going Fox (warranty) and they won't be here til wed. If this company works as well as the lady I talked to on the phone then I cant give enough stars! She was awesome. Please use this company!!! Unfortunately I had to cancel and wait til this other company shows up.

Thank you High Mark Plumbing for your responsive and thorough help - during the winter holidays no less. From my initial call to Kat, while I was stressed about my townhouse appliances (a few things broke down within a two week span); emails with Kat and Scott B, to help me with Strata-required documentation and schedule the assessment & install; visit, assessment, and quote from Morgan F who presented multiple options - HWT with/without expander, additional warranty, etc. - and helped me understand the longer term picture (and why other band-aid solutions - that he didn't recommend, but neighbours were trying to convince me to do - wouldn't be wise financially nor structurally); and finally the installation itself, with Billy M, who quietly & efficiently installed the Hot Water Tank & Expander, respectfully moving throughout my house (without judgement of its state of mess). I can now get back to the comfort and ease of having hot water running through my home, without worry that it'll shut off (or worse) for many years. Paying for peace of mind is worth the unexpected cost during the holidays, thank you.

We recently had a new gas furnace installed and our roof venting converted to run out the front of the house, and the whole experience was excellent. Brent and Martin did an outstanding job on the install. Initially we thought we were going to have no choice but exposed piping across our laundry room ceiling, but much to our delight they took the time to run everything encased in the wall. Kevin handled the initial inspection and also came by quickly when a fuse blew, which we really appreciated. He tweaked some settings and we've had no issues since. Everyone went above and beyond, and the work was done incredibly well. We even got a new thermostat installed by them which was also unexpected and extremely welcome. We’re very happy with the results and feel confident we’re in good hands.

Impressive customer service and technician.....I discoverd a gutter spout over flowing at the ground level drain during heavy rain. I contacted High Mark due to their positive reviews. The contact person was helpful and professional .The specialist plumber arrived on time the next day. Dane was patient and encouraged me to explain the issue, history and other whole house potential issues.Dane scoped the drain tile with his high tech camera. Dane displayed the blockage to me. A lower portion of the down spout that fed into the drainage system had broken off and then blocked all the leaves etc. causing the block.Dane removed the metal down spout detached metal portion and the water flowed freely.Dane was very impressive in his experience and an overall friendly guy.

My call was answered promptly on a Sunday long weekend morning and the gal put me thru to a fellow who was able to talk me through to shut the water off and shut down the hot water tank completely. And within an hour Kevin arrived to save the day. He was prompt, explained everything clearly, answered any questions I had as well. Within a few hours I had a new hot water tank. I would call this company again. Thank you, Kevin/Highmark Plumbing & Heating

Ryan came by and fixed 3 toilets that we were having issues with. He was workmanlike and professional in his demeanor. Our female cat who doesn't normally like people actually let him pet her! One of the toilets was not getting water for some reason and he fixed that too. I am pleased with his service.------------prior visit ----------------Tassos did a great job. He explained everything he was doing and his logic behind it. Although we were unable to reproduce the leak, he did show pictures of where water stains had occurred and these were all above the drain. We think that the source of the leak was from leaky shower attachment which then caused a stream of water to run towards the shower/tub control. Since he had previously reapplied silicone to that control, we were unable to reproduce the leak.

## What is a Heating Emergency?

When temperatures drop, prompt action is essential to keep you and your heating system safe. We’re here 24/7 to address any of the following problems at all hours:

- **System Not Heating Your Home:** When you have no heat, quick professional help is essential to stay safe and warm. Call us right away to make sure your home is safe, and your system runs smoothly again.
- **Carbon Monoxide Warning:** This gas is a health hazard and can cause fatalities. Contact us immediately so we can ensure a safe home for you to return to.
- **Odd Noises or Smells:** Strange sounds or smells suggest serious internal issues that can worsen without fast, expert help.
- **Cycling System:** If your system keeps turning on and off, not only does it waste energy but also indicates a problem in your system that needs urgent attention.
- **Leaks:** Water leaking from your heating system can damage your home and suggest a malfunction that requires prompt fixing.
- **Electrical Problems:** When your heating is on and your lights flicker or breakers trip, your heating system may have electrical issues that need immediate professional care.
