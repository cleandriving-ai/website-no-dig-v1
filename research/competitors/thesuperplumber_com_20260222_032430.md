Garret was knowledgeable, friendly and easily explained how he would do the job. The first day he installed a new hot water heater and did a lot of exploratory work on how to replace the poly b plumbing. The next few days the crew replaced the poly b.

## Plumbing FAQs

### What Are The Super Plumber’s Service Areas?

-

The Super Plumber currently operates in British Columbia ( **[Victoria](https://thesuperplumber.com/victoria/), [Nanaimo](https://thesuperplumber.com/nanaimo/), [Parksville](https://thesuperplumber.com/parksville/), [Vancouver](https://thesuperplumber.com/vancouver/)**) and Ontario ( **[Ottawa](https://thesuperplumber.com/ottawa/), [Guelph](https://thesuperplumber.com/guelph/), [Hamilton](https://thesuperplumber.com/hamilton/), [Kingston](https://thesuperplumber.com/kingston/), [Kitchener](https://thesuperplumber.com/kitchener/), [London](https://thesuperplumber.com/london/), [St. Catharines](https://thesuperplumber.com/st-catharines/), [Sudbury](https://thesuperplumber.com/sudbury/), [Trenton](https://thesuperplumber.com/trenton/)**), as well as [**Winnipeg, Manitoba**](https://thesuperplumber.com/winnipeg/), with plans to expand our plumbing services to additional provinces and cities in the near future.

### When should I upgrade my plumbing fixtures?

+

Upgrade your plumbing fixtures if they’re outdated, leaking, or inefficient, which can lead to higher water bills. If your fixtures are made of materials prone to corrosion, like older copper or galvanized steel, it’s a good time to replace them to prevent further issues.

### What should I do in the event of a leak or flood?

+

In the event of a leak or flood, immediately turn off the water and electricity to avoid further damage or hazards. If your water supply line is leaking turn off the main water supply shut off valve. Move valuables and furniture to higher ground, then start removing standing water with a wet-dry vacuum or towels.

## Plumbing FAQs

### What Are The Super Plumber’s Service Areas?

-

The Super Plumber currently operates in British Columbia (Victoria, Nanaimo, Parksville) and Ontario (Ottawa), with plans to expand our plumbing service in Ottawa to additional provinces and cities in the near future.

### When should I upgrade my plumbing fixtures?

+

### When to Upgrade Your Fixtures

Is it time for a fixture-face-lift? If your plumbing fixtures are outdated, leaking, or just plain inefficient, they’re probably costing you money on your water bill. If your fixtures are made of older materials like galvanized steel or copper, they might be a ticking time bomb for corrosion and bigger issues down the line. Upgrading your fixtures is a smart move that can save you money, prevent future headaches, and give your home a fresh new look. It’s a win-win-win!

### What should I do in the event of a leak or flood?

+

### What to Do During a Plumbing Emergency

Plumbing emergencies are never a good time, but don’t panic! In the event of a leak or flood, the first step is to turn off the water and electricity immediately. If a water supply line is leaking, find that main water shut-off valve and turn it off to stop the flow. Then, it’s time to start the rescue mission! Move any valuables and furniture to higher ground and begin removing the standing water with a wet-dry vacuum or towels. We’re on our way to help, but these first steps can save you from a lot of extra trouble.

### Does The Super Plumber serve areas around Ottawa?

+

Yes, The Super Plumber offers plumbing services in Ottawa and surrounding areas such as Orleans, Kanata, Nepean, Carlton Place and Barrhaven.

Catlin came from a service under another name, but it was the Super Plumber van so I wanted to give a good review here too. Excellent work, professional, polite, explained the costs, and the details of the repairs, there was no pressure, and was able to fix right away. Well worth the call, thank you.

## Drain & Sewer FAQs

### What is hydro jetting, and how does it work?

-

Hydro jetting is an advanced drain cleaning method that effectively eliminates stubborn clogs, grease, and debris from your pipes. This technique utilizes high-pressure water directed through a specialized nozzle to thoroughly flush out blockages, restoring smooth water flow. Unlike traditional drain snaking, hydro jetting doesn’t just clear existing obstructions but also helps prevent future build-ups, ensuring your plumbing system stays in optimal condition.

### How can I tell if my drains need professional cleaning?

+

If your plumbing isn’t performing as it should, it might be time for a professional drain cleaning. Some common signs to watch out for include:

- Slow drainage in sinks, bathtubs, or showers
- Frequent clogs or recurring backups
- Unpleasant odours emanating from drains
- Unusual sounds, like gurgling or bubbling, when water drains

If you notice any of these issues, reach out to a professional plumber to have your drains fully cleaned and restored to peak efficiency.

### How does a sewer video inspection work?

+

Sewer camera inspections involve using a waterproof, high-definition camera mounted on a flexible cable, which is carefully inserted into your sewer lines. The camera transmits real-time video footage, allowing plumbing experts to identify problems such as cracks, blockages, or tree root intrusion, all without the need for invasive digging. By pinpointing issues accurately, video inspections make it much easier to determine the best repair solution.

### Common Dishwasher Problems in Ottawa: Expert Repairs by The Super Plumber Ottawa

#### **Is Your Dishwasher Acting Up in Ottawa?**

A malfunctioning dishwasher can be a major inconvenience, especially if it’s leaking, failing to drain properly, or making strange noises. Even more frustrating is when your dishwasher refuses to turn on or starts emitting unpleasant odours, even after a “clean” cycle. If you’re experiencing any of these issues, it’s essential to have a professional plumber take a look before the problem worsens. In the meantime, you may find yourself resorting to washing dishes by hand—an annoying and time-consuming task.

#### **Common Dishwasher Problems That Need Professional Attention in Ottawa**

If you’re in Ottawa and facing any of the following problems, it’s time to call **The Super Plumber Ottawa**:

- **Leaking Dishwashers:** Water pooling around the base of your appliance is a sure sign that something isn’t working properly. This could be caused by a variety of issues, including worn seals or loose hoses.
- **Dishwasher Not Draining Fully:** If water remains at the bottom of your dishwasher after a cycle, the drain pump or filter may be clogged, or there could be a blockage in the drain hose.
- **Excessive Noise:** A dishwasher that is louder than usual could have an issue with the motor, spray arm, or other components that require attention.
- **Dishwasher Won’t Turn On:** If your appliance isn’t responding, the problem could be electrical, a faulty door switch, or a malfunctioning control panel.
- **Odours from the Dishwasher:** A foul smell may indicate food debris trapped in the filter or drain, or it could be a sign of bacterial growth inside the dishwasher itself.

If you encounter any of these issues, don’t hesitate to contact **The Super Plumber Ottawa** for expert troubleshooting and repair. Our experienced team is here to get your dishwasher back in working order quickly and effectively, so you can enjoy the convenience of your appliance again.

Catlin came from a service under another name, but it was the Super Plumber van so I wanted to give a good review here too. Excellent work, professional, polite, explained the costs, and the details of the repairs, there was no pressure, and was able to fix right away. Well worth the call, thank you.

Who can deny the significance of clean, contaminant-free drinking water? One might think that with all the industrial filtration processes, the water coming to our homes is entirely free of harmful chemicals and pollutants. However, this isn’t the truth.

You’d be surprised (and slightly disgusted) to know **what’s secretly hiding in your tap water**. If you’re using groundwater, for example, it’s most likely contaminated with microorganisms, pesticides, herbicides, organic substances, chemicals, and other artificial and natural pollutants.

On the other hand, if you’re using city water, it’s most likely polluted by **chloramine** and **chlorine**. The city filtration system uses these chemicals to disinfect the water. Moreover, the water might contain harmful substances like **arsenic nitrates and elevated lead levels**.

When it comes to protecting your family’s health, a [water filtration system](https://thesuperplumber.com/plumbing/water-filtration-system/) is more of a necessity and a luxury.

## Benefits of Water Filtration System

Let’s look at the main benefits of installing a water filtration system in your home:

**Saving Money**

Let’s do some calculations. Say you drink an average of 3 litres of water every day. To keep up with your fresh water supply, you purchase bottled water. The cost of these plastic bottles may not seem like much initially.

But if you add them up, you’ll find you have spent $100 or more over the course of a year. That’s a big waste of your hard-earned money and an even more considerable amount of plastic waste, polluting the environment. Now, think about purchasing a water filtration system instead.

Sure, it will involve a significant upfront investment. But think long term, consider how much you can save over a year and eventually over a decade! With minimal plumbing maintenance, you can further increase its lifespan.

Besides, the systems come with a warranty period. So, you can rest assured of having an **uninterrupted supply of clean water** for many, many years. You get fresh, clean water every time you open your tap.

**Saving Time**

Here’s the truth. Whether it’s a pitcher of filtered water in the fridge or a heavy blue water bottle on a water cooler, none of us like refilling the water container. Especially when you’re living with your family, it seems like you run out of water almost as soon as you fill the container!

It’s tiring, mundane, and necessitates a lot of time that you could otherwise spend on more productive things. You certainly don’t want to run out of drinking water because you forgot to refill the container trying to manage a hundred other things.

When you’re in a rush, you need ready-to-access, super clean water from the tap. And that’s where **a water filtration system can help**!

**Protecting Your Plumbing**

The sediment in unfiltered water accumulates in your pipelines, eventually clogging them. The unfiltered water wreaks havoc on your water-using appliances, like your [water heater](https://thesuperplumber.com/plumbing/water-heater/) and dishwasher. We’ve all experienced calcium build-up in our coffee makers and shower heads…

Plumbing issues are hard to detect unless they reach a point where the situation has become out of control. Toilets that won’t flush, bathtubs and basements getting backed up with sewage water, unpleasant odour, outrageous water bills, discoloured water, and poor water pressure are only a few of the signs of an issue.

By installing a water filtration system, you take an essential step in protecting your plumbing. The second is scheduling regular maintenance visits with a plumbing service. This is where The Super Plumber can help! We have been Greater **Victoria’s trusted plumbing service** since 2008. The Super Plumber is known for its exceptional, reliable, and 24/7 plumbing, sewer, and drain repair services.

**Improving Your Health**

Harmful chemicals in unfiltered water are rough for your skin and hair health, especially for people with psoriasis and eczema. The substances can aggravate the condition by causing skin dryness.

Your hair, too, becomes dry and brittle due to unfiltered water. After installing a water filtration system, you’ll notice a visible difference in your hair and skin.

The system rids your water of disease-causing pathogens, dangerous pollutants, and sediments. As a result, it will also improve your immunity. If the last two years have taught us anything, it’s crucial to have a robust immune system!

**Enhancing Air Quality**

Consider this a fringe benefit. Many daily activities like doing laundry, bathing, and cooking require water. Inadvertently, the water is often splashing around. As a result, it becomes a part of your home’s indoor humidity.

Unhealthy water thus contributes to poor air quality. The water filtration system gives you much-needed peace of mind knowing that your indoor atmosphere does not contain chemicals and toxins.

**Call Us!**

Here at The Super Plumber, we also offer in-home [water quality testing](https://thesuperplumber.com/plumbing/water-treatment/). If you’re not sure whether you need a water filtration system, water quality testing is a good first step. Whether you need the water filtration system installed or are facing a [plumbing issue](https://thesuperplumber.com/plumbing/), don’t hesitate to call us at 250-995-1234. [The Super Plumber](https://thesuperplumber.com/) will dispatch experienced and certified plumbing professionals to your doorstep right away!

[Plumbing leaks](https://thesuperplumber.com/plumbing/water-leak-detection/) are a pain in the backside for every homeowner. If left unchecked, the water damage can be extensive and expensive to the point of breaking the bank. Who wants that?

Plumbing leaks may make you want to pull your hair out because they are tough to detect. And when the signs of leaking water become evident, most of the damage has already been done.

Thousands of dollars – down the drain!

There’s an easy way out of it – detecting the early signs of leaking water and calling a certified plumber to prevent costly repairs later down the road.

If you identify any of these signs, contact a reliable plumbing service like The Super Plumber instead of pressing the panic button:

### Leaky Washing Machine Hose

Good things come to those who wait. But not when you’re facing a serious plumbing problem. Washing machines are one of the most used appliances in a household. Don’t take the wait-and-see approach if you notice a leak due to a bulge or crack.

Call a plumbing expert before the leaking water forms a mould behind your washing machine, which we all know is a significant health hazard.

Don’t take matters into your own hands because most homeowners don’t have the necessary plumbing tools, skills or experience to fix water leaks like these.

If you didn’t know before, the mould could even damage the machine’s performance. Hence, dialling a plumbing service protects your health, appliance, and property!

Need we say more?

Now, let’s talk about the second sign.

### Dripping Faucets & Leaking Pipes

Most of us don’t think much of dripping faucets. But think about it. Let’s say your kitchen faucet is dripping ten times per minute. You’re then likely losing 400 gallons of water a year! If you don’t feel it now, wait till your water bill arrives.

It certainly won’t put a smile on your face. Don’t forget the cost of mould and water damage repair you’d have to bear too. Should you contact an experienced plumber as soon as you notice a leaking faucet or fixture? You bet your bottom dollar!

### But what about pipes?

Also, something not to be ignored!

Leaking or burst pipes can cause flood damage, even in places you cannot see. Treat it as an emergency even if your house hasn’t started to flood yet because any damage to your flooring or drywall will likely be irreversible.

When you detect a leaky pipe, swiftly turn off the main water supply, then call a plumber immediately.

A licensed plumber will not only prevent further damage and fix (or replace) the pipe but also thoroughly check your entire plumbing system to ensure there are no more plumbing issues inside and outside your property.

### No Hot Water

Imagine heading to your shower after a long day only to find there is no hot water. Frustrating, isn’t it?

It’s also a significant sign that your home requires a deep plumbing inspection and repair. A leaky [water heater](https://thesuperplumber.com/plumbing/water-heater/) can and will flood your property if you don’t seek help immediately. Once again, never attempt to fix the water heater yourself.

If you aren’t a plumbing expert, you risk getting injured or burned. Certain appliances like water heaters can only be repaired by certified contractors who can also future-proof your home against water damage.

### Low Water Pressure

Some signs of leaking water are right in your face (hint: a dripping faucet); others aren’t. Low water pressure is one of those low-key signs of a cracked or leaking pipe. Time to press the emergency button!

Speaking of plumbing emergencies, The Super Plumber will dispatch certified professionals as soon as you dial our number, 250-995-1234. We are available at all times – night and day – for residents in Vancouver Island and Greater Victoria.

### Overflowing Toilet

If this isn’t a tell-tale sign of a plumbing crisis, what is?

It happens when the seal connecting the bowl with the toilet tank gets damaged. As a result, water keeps leaking even after several minutes of flushing the toilet.

The constant sound of running water in your toilet might also hint at a bigger problem. Call a professional if the issue isn’t easily remedied by jiggling the handle a few times. An overflowing toilet can also be caused by sewage issues, blocked vents, clogged pipes, etc. These are all serious issues that require the help of a licensed plumber.

As soon as you notice something like this, seek professional help. Otherwise, it might come to a point where you can’t use the toilet at all. And that’s never a good thing.

Don’t hesitate.

[Contact The Super Plumber](https://thesuperplumber.com/contact-us/) at the first sign of plumbing issues. Dial 250-995-1234 and say goodbye to all your plumbing troubles!
