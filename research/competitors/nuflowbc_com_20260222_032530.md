## **BEFORE**

## **&**

## **AFTER PIPE LINING**

### **WHAT IS PIPE RELINING?**

Over the past few decades, advancements in science and engineering have led to the development of cutting-edge and eco-friendly pipe repair methods. The new techniques allow for broken pipes to be fixed from the inside without having to dig.

These methods, referred to as trenchless repairs, CIPP (cured in place pipe) lining, generally involve leaving the old pipes (or what remains of them) in place and inserting a new pipe, made of durable composite epoxy resin, inside of them. This eliminates the need for excavation, digging, or destruction, and provides clients with a more cost-effective and convenient solution for their problematic pipes, while minimizing any negative effects.

### **WHAT IS CIPP RELINING?**

Cured-in-place pipe relining (CIPP) is an effective method for repairing or rehabilitating pipes without the need for excavation or disruption to the surrounding area. This process involves inserting a liner made of advanced composite materials, such as resin, into the damaged pipe. The liner is shaped to fit the interior of the pipe and is then cured in place to form a seamless, rock-hard repair.

CIPP is suitable for a variety of pipes, including those carrying rainwater, waste, grey water, and chemicals. The liner can also be reinforced with materials, such as fiberglass, to provide structural support and increase the strength of the repair. This makes CIPP an ideal solution for pipes located beneath roads or driveways, where excavation is not an option.

CIPP can be used to repair a variety of pipe damage, including cracks, corrosion, and root intrusion. The process can also improve the flow of the pipe and extend its overall lifespan. This can help to prevent costly and disruptive excavation in the future and reduce the need for frequent repairs.

Overall, CIPP is a cost-effective and efficient solution for repairing or rehabilitating pipes without the need for excavation. It can save time and money while reducing disruption to the surrounding area and improving the overall performance of the pipes.

### **THE BENEFITS OF PIPE RELINING**

#### **TRENCHLESS PIPE REPAIR CIPP RELINING CAN:**

- Fix leaks and prevent tree root intrusion
- Assist with prevention of blocked drains
- Eliminate digging, excavation and destruction
- Increase effectiveness and fluid flow rate

- Reduce the risk of potential damage to other services cause by excavation
- Provide a structural repair – even to sections where no pipe exists
- Be used in situations where pipes have junctions, bends, and transitions in diameter

- Can be used to repair pipes of almost any material (PVC, concrete, clay, copper, cast, steel, etc)
- Repair pipes conveying chemicals, high temperature fluids, waste, and more
- Usually result in simpler and more cost-effective solutions than digging and repairing or replacing the damaged pipes.

### **NU FLOW’S PIPE RELINING METHODS**

One of the most popular ways of repairing or rehabilitating pipes without digging is CIPP (cured-in-place) pipe relining. Put simply, advanced composite epoxy resin materials are inserted into failing pipes to repair damage, improve flow, and extend the life of the pipe. For pipes needing structural strength (i.e. beneath roads or driveways) a liner impregnated with epoxy resins is pushed or pulled into the pipe to cure, forming a new pipe lining that will keep it operating successfully for years to come.

These structural and non-structural relining processes are suitable for pipes carrying waste, storm water, rain, chemical (trade) applications and industrial applications.

Our pipe relining methods are tailored to suit each unique repair, and vary depending upon the type of pipe, the climate, other environmental conditions, the operational needs of the client and the built structures or services in the immediate area.

We use CCTV camera equipment to locate the issue, then we use highly specialized tools to clear the pipes and prepare them for relining.

### **NU DRAIN IS SUITED TO A WIDE RANGE OF PIPING SYSTEMS, INCLUDING:**

Mains, horizontal laterals, vertical stacks, sanitary systems, storm/roof drains, vent systems, processed/industrial/chemical piping, other waste systems, residential & commercial properties, industrial, municipal, federal properties, swimming pools

### **COMMON TYPES OF PIPE THAT CAN BE REPAIRED INCLUDE:**

Clay, concrete, metal, iron, cast, steel, PVC, fiberglass. We will look at all types of pipes and try to develop a solution for every unique scenario

### **COMMON PIPE PROBLEMS WE REPAIR INCLUDE:**

Tree root intrusion, bottom gone, mis-aligned, offsets, water intrusion, missing pipe, broken pipe, partially collapsed pipe

### **TYPICAL TYPES OF PIPE PROBLEMS WE SEE EVERYDAY**

- Broken, cracked, offset or collapsed pipes
- Damaged sewer lines due to shifting soil, frozen ground, settling, tec.
- Grease blockages and build-ups or a foreign object is restricting or prohibiting proper flow and or cleaning of the sewer line.
- Corrosion: the sewer pipe has deteriorated and/or broken, causing sections of the pipe to be missing, bottom of the pipe to be gone, pipe to collapse and restrict flow
- Leaking joints: The seals between pipes have broken, allowing into the area surrounding the pipe.
- Bellied pipe: A section of the sewer pipe has sunk due to ground or soil conditions, creating a valley that collects paper and waste.
- Roots in a fewer line: Tree or shrub roots have invaded the sewer pipe, preventing normal cleaning and/or roots have damaged the pipe
- Off-grade pipe: Existing pipes are constructed of substandard or outdated material that may have deteriorated or corroded or the ground where the pipe was installed has changed the level of the pipe has changed.

Another advantage of CIPP is its flexibility in terms of pipe size and shape. The liner can be customized to fit any size or shape of pipe, making it an ideal solution for pipes with unique dimensions. This also helps to ensure a tight, secure fit that provides a long-lasting repair.

In addition, CIPP is a green and environmentally-friendly solution as it minimizes excavation and reduces the amount of waste generated during the repair process. It also eliminates the need for heavy machinery and excavation equipment, which can cause damage to the surrounding environment and infrastructure.

The process of CIPP is relatively quick and efficient, with most repairs completed within a day or two. This helps to reduce downtime and minimize disruptions to the normal flow of water and waste through the pipes. Additionally, the cured liner forms a smooth, seamless surface inside the pipe, which helps to reduce turbulence and increase flow efficiency.

In conclusion, CIPP is a reliable and cost-effective solution for repairing or rehabilitating pipes. It offers a number of benefits over traditional excavation methods, including reduced downtime, minimal disruption, improved flow, and increased longevity.

## CIPP Cured in Place Pipe Lining   Frequently Asked Questions

#### [How can I tell if there is a problem with my plumbing?](https://www.nuflowbc.com/faqs/\#1480311464586-a4f45bdc-08af)

Common indicators of failing drain lines are cracks in the visible pipes, leaks, water stains, mold, slow drains and backup.

#### [What types of pipe systems can you line?](https://www.nuflowbc.com/faqs/\#1480311975836-a6a8ea5f-77b4)

We have the technology to line the following mechanical pipe systems: vertical drains, sanitary stacks, horizontal sewer lines, mains, roof drain systems, processed piping, conduit lines, fuel lines and chemical lines with diameters from 1-1/2″ to 36″ sizes.

#### [Why is Pipe Lining better than replacing the pipes?](https://www.nuflowbc.com/faqs/\#1480311973555-5c4d6298-7de7)

Pipe replacement in aging facilities, the traditional alternative to pipe lining, comes with a host of concerns and issues that must be dealt with, some of which can render such work highly prohibitive.

**These include:**

- Destruction of existing walls, ceilings, floors and underground structures
- Patching and repair of the damaged structure
- Inconvenience and disruption to building/facility occupants or residents
- Safety concerns where asbestos insulation or other contaminants are present
- The need to temporarily vacate occupants and dwelling tenants
- High monetary cost

#### [What is Pull-in-Place pipe lining?](https://www.nuflowbc.com/faqs/\#1480311970381-e783902e-80ee)

Pull in place pipe lining is an effective process that restores corroded or eroded drain, waste and vent piping systems without the costly expense and destruction required to replace pipes.

#### [History of pipe lining (CIPP)](https://www.nuflowbc.com/faqs/\#1629339744531-d0d8fa8c-04cb)

In the early 1970’s, Eric Wood developed the first cured-in-place pipe technology (CIPP) in England. He then named the CIPP process insitu form, meaning “form in place” in Latin. Wood received patent no. 4009063 for this technology on February 22, 1977 and was commercialized by Insituform Technologies on February 22, 1994 when CIPP entered the public domain.

During this time the CIPP market’s main focus was on large diameter pipes from 4” to 118” and geared towards the municipal sector. This process was called “inversion” and required large equipment and in most cases, would require digging pits for it to effectively work.

During the 1990’s in Toronto, Canada a new technology would emerge in the CIPP market. Cameron Manners, the founder of NuFlow and inventor of the technology, saw a void in the CIPP market and developed a pull-in-place method that focus on the small diameter market of 2” to 12” pipes.

NuFlow has received multiple patents for its pull-in-place structural lining process and methods and since its inception has licensed the technology to nearly 400 companies internationally with installation on 6 continents.

NuFlow’s pull-in-place method has revolutionized the CIPP market by bringing the structural liner inside the building. NuFlow has been the leader in inside infrastructure rehabilitation. The pull-in-place method requires the use of existing access points along with the flexibility in the product and how to apply it. The process allows for full control by pulling or pushing the liner into place, a perfect match for large projects within the building’s infrastructure.

#### [Pipe Lining provides an efficient, effective alternative:](https://www.nuflowbc.com/faqs/\#1629339841578-35cc24ce-150f)

- Significant savings over repipe or pipe replacement
- Increases life of piping
- Very little disruption, if any
- Preservation of building structure and surrounding landscape or hardscape
- Little to no destruction to the property

#### Broken pipes, tree roots, offset pipes, bottom gone, corroded pipes

# Sewer Line Pipe Inspections: Ensuring the Health of Your Plumbing System

Your sewer line pipes are a critical component of your plumbing system, responsible for carrying waste and wastewater away from your home or business. Regular sewer line pipe inspections are essential to ensure that your pipes are in good working order and to identify any issues before they become major problems.

## Why are sewer line pipe inspections important?

Sewer line pipes are underground, so it can be difficult to know when there is a problem. Regular inspections help identify potential issues before they turn into bigger problems, such as blockages, leaks, or even collapses. By catching these issues early, you can avoid costly repairs, minimize the risk of property damage, and protect the health and safety of your family.

In addition, sewer line pipe inspections can help you make informed decisions about your property. For example, if you are buying a new home, an inspection can reveal any existing or potential issues with the sewer line pipes. This information can help you negotiate the purchase price or decide whether to walk away from the sale.

## What to expect during a sewer line pipe inspection

During a sewer line pipe inspection, our qualified inspector will use a camera to inspect and record the interior of your pipes. The inspector will insert a flexible rod with a high-resolution camera attached into the pipes through a clean-out access point or other access point in your home or business. The camera transmits live video footage of the interior of your pipes, allowing the inspector to identify any issues, such as blockages, corrosion, cracks, leaks, tree roots, and other possible issues.

After the inspection, the inspector will provide you with a copy of the video inspectioon online which you will allow you to review the condition of your sewer line pipes and any issues that were identified. If any issues were found, the inspector can also provide recommendations for repairs or replacement.

# STRESS FREE DRAIN CLEANING & CLEARING

Clogged pipes, drains and sewers that aren’t cleared can result in major disruption, health hazards and costly repairs to assets in your home or business. The longer pipes go without blockages being addressed the risker the problem becomes.

Nuflow technicians are experts in blocked drain and sewer cleaning and clearing and have the right equipment to clear clogged pipes quickly and thoroughly.

Our pipe inspection cameras pin point the exact location of blocked or leaking drain and sewer pipes. We then use a variety of methods including water jetting and specialized plumbing pipe cleaning tools to ensure your pipe or drain is cleared and cleaned quickly and safely.

![](https://www.nuflowbc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jetter-dude.png)

# THE BLOCKED DRAIN CLEANING PROCESSS

## WATER PRESSURE

Our equipment provides high-volume and high-pressure water jetting with a range of specialist nozzles to unblock drains from 1-/2" to 8" in diameter. Water is pumped at pressures of up to 3000 PSI through a hose which is inserted carefully into the blocked drain.

## HYDROJET FITTED

The hydrojet hose is fitted with a nozzle which produces a stream of water forwards to clear the pipe ahead, and backwards, to produce enough force to propel the hose through the pipe.

## DEBRIS REMOVAL

The high-pressure water easily cuts through tree roots and dislodges pipe blockages, flushing out sand, silt and other debris.

## INSPECTION

Once the blocked drain has been flushed, we use a high-tech pipe inspection camera to inspect the pipe and identify the source of the blockage. We record the entire inspection and provide a copy for our clients to keep.

![](https://www.nuflowbc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tree-roots-pipe.png)

# CLEARING BLOCKED DRAINS

Nuflow technicians are trained and experienced in clearing clogged pipes with all sorts of problems, including heavy duty clearing of debris from sewage and storm water pipes.

Our cleaning and clearing equipment easily manage pipe blockages caused by:

- Tree Roots

## **AFTER PIPE LINING**

### **WHAT IS PIPE LINING?**

Breakthroughs in the field of science and engineering over past decades have resulted in  innovative and environmentally-friendly pipe repair technologies. Making it possible for broken pipes to be repaired from the inside without the need to dig at all.

Known as trenchless repairs, old pipes (or their remnants) are usually let in place while a new pipe (often made with tough durable composite epoxy resin materials) is simply formed or situated inside or around them. With no need to excavate, dig or destroy, trenchless repair strategies such as cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) lining usually gives clients more cost-effective and convenient solutions for troublesome pipes, and results in significantly fewer negative impacts.

### **WHAT IS CIPP LINING?**

One of the most popular ways of repairing or rehabilitating pipes without digging is CIPP (cured-in-place) pipe lining. Put simply, advanced composite resin materials are inserted into failing pipes to repair damage, improve flow and extend the life of the pipe. For pipes needing structural strength (i.e. beneath roads or driveways) a liner impregnated with the epoxy resins is pulled or pushed into place before being cured rock hard.

These structural and non-structural lining processes are suitable for pipes carrying rain water, waste, grey water, chemical (trade) applications and industrial applications.

### **THE BENEFITS OF PIPE LINING**

#### **TRENCHLESS PIPE REPAIR CIPP LINING CAN:**

- Fix leaks and prevent tree root intrusion
- Assist with prevention of blocked drains
- Eliminate digging, excavation and destruction
- Increase effectiveness and fluid flow rate

- Reduce the risk of potential damage to other services cause by excavation
- Provide a structural repair – even to sections where no pipe exists
- Be used in situations where pipes have junctions, bends, and transitions in diameter

- Can be used to repair pipes of almost any material (PVC, concrete, clay, copper, cast, steel, etc)
- Repair pipes conveying chemicals, high temperature fluids, waste, and more
- Usually result in simpler and more cost-effective solutions than digging and repairing or replacing the damaged pipes.

### **NU FLOW’S PIPE LINING METHODS**

One of the most popular ways of repairing or rehabilitating pipes without digging is CIPP (cured-in-place) pipe lining. Put simply, advanced composite epoxy resin materials are inserted into failing pipes to repair damage, improve flow, and extend the life of the pipe. For pipes needing structural strength (i.e. beneath roads or driveways) a liner impregnated with epoxy resins is pushed or pulled into the pipe to cure, forming a new pipe lining that will keep it operating successfully for years to come.

These structural and non-structural lining processes are suitable for pipes carrying waste, storm water, rain, chemical (trade) applications and industrial applications.

Our pipe lining methods are tailored to suit each unique repair, and vary depending upon the type of pipe, the climate, other environmental conditions, the operational needs of the client and the built structures or services in the immediate area.

We use CCTV camera equipment to locate the issue, then we use highly specialized tools to clear the pipes and prepare them for lining.

### **NU DRAIN IS SUITED TO A WIDE RANGE OF PIPING SYSTEMS, INCLUDING:**

Mains, horizontal laterals, vertical stacks, sanitary systems, storm/roof drains, vent systems, processed/industrial/chemical piping, other waste systems, residential & commercial properties, industrial, municipal, federal properties, swimming pools

### **COMMON TYPES OF PIPE THAT CAN BE REPAIRED INCLUDE:**

Clay, concrete, metal, iron, cast, steel, PVC, fiberglass. We will look at all types of pipes and try to develop a solution for every unique scenario

### **COMMON PIPE PROBLEMS WE REPAIR INCLUDE:**

Tree root intrusion, bottom gone, mis-aligned, offsets, water intrusion, missing pipe, broken pipe, partially collapsed pipe

### CIPP PIPE LINING

Utilizing cutting-edge technology, trenchless sewer repair has never been easier. With trenchless sewer repair, the need for digging trenches is eliminated, all that is needed is an access point hole to allow for equipment.

Repairing or replacing sewer pipes is already a headache and an inconvenience that you have to worry about. Make the process easy and cost effective by using NuFlow’s technology that accesses the sewer system through one or two entrance points. The best part is that your business or family can go about their daily routine with little to no disruption. In addition to saving time and money, trenchless sewer repair prolongs the life of your system, eliminates costly backups and improves water flow since pipes are lined with our patented, environmentally friendly epoxy that stands up to the challenge of everyday use. We are proud to offer these techniques while not disturbing plants, trees, or bushes that can be habitat for wildlife.

## Pipe Locating and Mapping out Services

At Nu Flow we use the latest in pipe line inspection camera’s and locating equipment. Using our technology you will be able to accurately locate the problem areas or map out your system.

### How it Works

Inside each of our pipe camera’s head is a sonde. This sonde sends a signal to a locating device from inside the pipe to the surface. From this we are able to tell the direction, location, and depth of the pipe.  Our camera’s also are able to tell us the slope of the pipe.  This is valuable information to know before if you need tot digging.

### Our Best Pipe Sizes and Types

At Nu Flow we use a number of different camera’s.  The pipe sizes that we can work in best range from 1-1/2″ (40mm) to 8″ (200mm). Our cameras inspect and locate pipes for sanitary lines, swimming pool lines, storm lines, gray water lines, production lines. If you have a pipe line we can inspect it and locate it for you.
