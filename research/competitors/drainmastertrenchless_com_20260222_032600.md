### Expert Trenchless Water Line Replacement Services for Repairing Damp, Wet, or Flooded Basements

Drain Master Plumbers are specialists in the repair and replacement of your home’s main water line without the need for digging trenches. With over 35 years of experience, our licensed plumbers use our patented “Pipe Genie” Pipe Bursting equipment to replace existing water line pipes with minimal damage to your home’s landscaping.

Trenchless pipe replacement is a method that eliminates the need for trenches to be dug in order to install or replace underground pipes.

This method, known as pipe bursting, involves bursting the old pipe and displacing the fragmented old pipe into the surrounding soil, creating a hole of roughly the same dimension as the original. The new pipe is then pushed or pulled into position.

Benefits of trenchless pipe replacement include time and cost efficiency, as well as minimal damage to landscaping. Our trenchless pipe bursting technology ensures that your lawns, driveways, and gardens remain intact during the replacement process. We only require two small holes, one for the pipe bursting equipment and one for the new water line to be pulled through.

- Expert **Trenchless Water Line Replacement** Services for Repairing Damp, Wet, or Flooded Basements

Water lines are a vital element in all modern residential and commercial spaces. If this pipe gets damaged then you will no longer have access to fresh, clean water, and you may find your daily activities grinding to a halt. Calling a plumber for emergency water line repair could be your only option, and you have to make sure that you hire someone experienced and trustworthy. Drain Master has been providing maintenance and emergency plumbing services in the GVA for over 35 years; we can bring you the cleanest fix without hidden costs, and fast.

All pipes wear down over time, and the material they are made from can make a big difference as to why they need repair. It can be as simple as corrosion and rust over time as with iron pipes, and as alarming as pressure changes causing an entire pipe to burst as with any pipe. Sometimes ABS, PVC or clay pipes crack due to shifts in the ground, the addition of a new structure above them, or just cold weather conditions. Finally, plant roots can find purchase and force their way into the pipe over time.



- The effects of water line damage can also range in scale. Some common problems include:

- Decreased water pressure throughout the building
- Brown or otherwise discoloured water
- Water damage and flooding

![Water Line Repair](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdobeStock_1292851899-1024x683.jpeg)

![Water Line Repair](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Water-Line-Repair-2-1024x684.jpg)

- What Is Trenchless **Water Line Repair**?

Modern plumbing experts often recommend trenchless water line repair because it saves our clients both time and money. This technique begins with a camera inspection; a camera on a long flexible pipe is lowered into the water line to isolate the damage. This means you will not have any unnecessary damage to your property while we search for the problem area.


Once the place is pinpointed the repairs can begin. Instead of digging a long trench and creating an unnecessary mess, we will only have to dig holes on either end of the damaged length of the pipe. Next, we insert a pipe-cutting head that drags the new length of the pipe behind it. We can finish the entire job within a single day, saving you a headache and a massive bill.

Lead pipes are a health and safety hazard according to the City of Vancouver.

Lead is a toxin that is absorbed into the body and stored in the muscles and bones, meaning that the damage will continue after the pipes have been removed, but replacing them will minimize their impact.

### 3 Reasons to Use Trenchless Water Line Replacement

### 1\. Replacing Old Materials

Traditionally, water service pipes are made up of lead or galvanized steel pipes. If you live in an older home in the GVA, there is a great chance that the water service pipe is made up of these materials. These materials can corrode and break down over time, causing a burst of the uncontrolled volume of water, loss of service and clogged drains possible structural damage to your home, and massive flooding. Corrosion can also cause remnants of lead to enter your bathing and drinking water, making it extremely dangerous to your health. Learn more about lead in drinking water here.

### 2\. Home Additions

If you’re planning a home renovation with increased water facilities, such as a home addition, additional washrooms, or more water facilities, using the same water pipe system can reduce the amount of water distributed throughout the house, resulting in low water pressure. Upgrading to a larger water pipe system will be able to accommodate the incoming water supply. It’s also best to check the requirements of your municipality, as many require households to upgrade the size of their pipe system to accommodate new fixtures.

![Trenchless Replacement](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/trenchless-laying-of-communications-fiber-optic-a-2023-11-27-05-04-39-utc-1024x683.jpg)

### 3\. Emergency Broken Water Line Replacement

Although older water pipes can last for a long time, the shift in the ground can create pressure that the material might not be able to withstand, leading to a high chance of Bursts. Factors such as cold weather, freezing water inside the pipe, and structures like sidewalks adding excess pressure can also contribute to the problem. Over time the material wears off, corrodes, and deposits on the walls. Even small vibrations can cause clogs in the line and, depending on the material, massive water main breaks and bursts.

#### **Common symptoms of a burst water line**:

- Flooding
- Higher water bills (if the pipe is burst inside the house after the meter)
- Lowered overall water pressure
- Contaminants in the home’s water supply
- Big green patch of grass on the front lawn
- Water seeping through the asphalt/concrete

If you are experiencing any of those issues, it is worthwhile to ask a Drain Master local plumbing expert to inspect your property and pipes. We offer emergency replacement of burst water pipes through trenchless water line repair that can often be completed in just under a day. This step can save you a lot of money by preventing further destruction and damage to your property.

### How Trenchless Water Pipe Replacement Works

The trenchless water line replacement technique only requires digging at either end of the section to be repaired, but this can only be done if the pipe is exposed to the property line and inside your basement. This is crucial, as attempting an excavation repair may disturb other pipes in the area, leading to extra breaks and problems. Here is our process of trenchless water pipe replacement:



![Trenchless Replacement](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/using-a-horizontal-directional-drilling-machine-t-2024-08-21-17-22-41-utc-1024x683.jpg)

### 1\. Locating the Water Line

We start by locating the exact position of the waterline using our state-of-the-art equipment. You are only responsible for the replacement of your line up to a certain line that acts as a border between your lot and the municipality. This is where we excavate the hole.

### 2\. Using the Torpedo Method

Inside the basement, we expose a 5′ long (1.4 meter) x 1′ wide (30 cm) hole going underneath the footing of your house to the hole excavated outside. This allows us to insert our torpedo so there are no obstacles in its path. The torpedo is set in motion through air and oil compressors, giving it the necessary force to crush through soil and rocks. However, the success of the procedure is dependent on the quality of the soil, with minimal stone and sand.

### 3\. New Pipe Insertion

After the torpedo is set in motion, we attach a copper/plastic coil to it and set it in reverse for the torpedo to make its way back into the basement, bringing along a new pipe. The pipe will be connected at the property line using corporation coupling or will be inserted directly into the curb stop. A new ball valve is installed inside the pipe before the meter and is then installed and connected to the system. This is the standard location of the meter but special relocations can be done if requested.

### How to Get Started

### 1\. Get an Estimate

Reach out to Drain Master Plumbing for a free estimate of the job. The assessment can be done either through a phone call, or a video call, or if the situation is not the typical standard and relocation of the water meter is required, an on-site job assessment will be done.



### 2\. Creating the Plan

Once our team is able to assess the situation, we can create an overall plan and provide a free quote for your trenchless water line replacement.



### 3\. Getting the Job Done

We will order the appropriate location inspection required from the municipality and follow the appropriate by-laws. Next, we will dispatch a team equipped with the required tools and equipment such as the excavator, torpedo, compressor, and everything else necessary to complete the work. Since we always are prepared to have everything required on-site, the process is seamless and usually requires 8 to 10 hours of work.


If the municipality requires the water to be turned off, you may expect a break of water service from 9 to 2 pm. There are some cases where we are able to connect to the water system without involving the municipality.

### Post Installation Service

1. The hole will be backfilled with water to ensure the highest compaction rate is achieved
2. We tramped down the hole with a Jumping Jack (a big piece of metal that jumps and compacts the soil). All excess soil and garbage is removed and properly disposed of by our team
3. Inside the basement, we re-finish the concrete and clean the floor. During the process, drop sheets and plastic are used to cover your belongings.
4. If an inspection is required by the municipality, we organize this on your behalf and ensure all the required paperwork is completed for any applicable programs that you can apply to within your municipality such as the [Priority Lead Pipe Replacement](https://www.vancouver.ca/services-payments/water-environment/tap-water-in-Vancouver/lead-drinking-water/priority-lead-water-service-replacement-program/) in Vancouver.
5. Once the job is completed, an invoice will be sent to you and you can make the payment through our secure portal.

- 3 Reasons to Use **Trenchless water line replacement**

- 1\. Replacing Old **Materials**

Traditionally, water service pipes are made up of lead or galvanized steel pipes. If you live in an older home in the GVA, there is a great chance that the water service pipe is made up of these materials. These materials can corrode and break down over time, causing a burst of the uncontrolled volume of water, loss of service and clogged drains possible structural damage to your home, and massive flooding. Corrosion can also cause remnants of lead to enter your bathing and drinking water, making it extremely dangerous to your health. Learn more about lead in drinking water here.


- 2\. Home **Additions**

If you’re planning a home renovation with increased water facilities, such as a home addition, additional washrooms, or more water facilities, using the same water pipe system can reduce the amount of water distributed throughout the house, resulting in low water pressure. Upgrading to a larger water pipe system will be able to accommodate the incoming water supply. It’s also best to check the requirements of your municipality, as many require households to upgrade the size of their pipe system to accommodate new fixtures.



- 3\. Emergency Broken **Water Line Replacement**

Although older water pipes can last for a long time, the shift in the ground can create pressure that the material might not be able to withstand, leading to a high chance of Bursts. Factors such as cold weather, freezing water inside the pipe, and structures like sidewalks adding excess pressure can also contribute to the problem. Over time the material wears off, corrodes, and deposits on the walls. Even small vibrations can cause clogs in the line and, depending on the material, massive water main breaks and bursts.


- Common symptoms of a burst water line:

- Flooding
- Higher water bills (if the pipe is burst inside the house after the meter)
- Lowered overall water pressure

- Contaminants in the home’s water supply
- Big green patch of grass on the front lawn
- Water seeping through the asphalt/concrete

If you are experiencing any of those issues, it is worthwhile to ask a Drain Master local plumbing expert to inspect your property and pipes. We offer emergency replacement of burst water pipes through trenchless water line repair that can often be completed in just under a day. This step can save you a lot of money by preventing further destruction and damage to your property.

![Pipe Replacement](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/featured-image-galvanizedpipes-640x400-2.jpg)

### What are galvanized pipes?

Galvanized pipes are steel pipes that have been dipped in a protective zinc coating to prevent corrosion and rust. Galvanized piping was commonly installed in homes built before 1960. When it was invented, galvanized pipe was an alternative to lead pipe for water supply lines. Today, however, we have learned that decades of exposure to water will cause galvanized pipes to corrode and rust on the inside.



### How long do galvanized pipes last?

No piping system lasts forever, but galvanized pipes have a life span of between 40 to 100 years. If your home’s pipes are from the 1960s or earlier, they are likely nearing the end of their functional life span. However, there’s a reason galvanized pipes are no longer used in modern construction: the risk they pose to a home’s water supply and people’s health.

### Are there safety risks or concerns with galvanized piping?

By far, the most significant problem related to galvanized pipes is the mineral deposits that accumulate within the piping. Over time, it causes a reduction in water pressure and pollutes your home’s water. And as rust and corrosion deepen, they compromise the piping system’s stability and cause leaks.

![Pipe Replacement](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/corrosion.jpg)

![Pipe Replacement](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MixCollage-30-Jan-2025-07-56-PM-581-1024x683.jpg)

### What do galvanized pipes look like?

When first installed, galvanized pipes look like nickel in color. But as they age, galvanized pipes may appear much duller, lighter, or darker, depending on their environment. We’ve also seen homes where the water pipes have been painted, so it can be difficult to tell at first glance.

### How can I tell if I have galvanized pipes?

If you can’t tell by looking at your pipes, there is a quick test to tell if they are galvanized. Simply grab a flathead screwdriver and a strong magnet. Start by finding your water line and scratch the outside of the pipe with the screwdriver.

![Pipe Replacement](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1-removebg-preview.png)

### Copper

The scratched area will look like a copper penny. A magnet will NOT stick to it.

![Pipe Replacement](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2-removebg-preview.png)

### Plastic

The scratched area will appear ivory or white in color. A magnet will NOT stick to it.

![Pipe Replacement](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3-removebg-preview-1.png)

### Galvanized steel

The scratched area will have a silver-gray color. A strong magnet will stick to it.

### Lead

The scratched area will have a dull silver-gray color, and the metal will usually be soft and easy to scratch. A magnet will NOT stick to it. Lead pipes are easy to bend and may be misshapen. If you have lead pipes, we recommend replacement if possible.

Be sure to scratch-test your pipes in multiple areas. It’s not uncommon to have more than one type of piping on your water line.

### Do galvanized pipes contain lead?

The galvanized pipes installed on water lines between 1880 and 1960 were dipped in molten, naturally occurring zinc. Naturally occurring zinc is impure, so these pipes were bathed in zinc that also contained lead and other impurities. The zinc coating elongated the life of the steel pipes but added small amounts of lead and other substances that could harm inhabitants.

![Pipe Replacement](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lead-pipe.jpg)

Additionally, if your galvanized pipes were ever connected to lead plumbing (including service lines) there is more cause for concern. The corrosion inside galvanized steel pipes could have trapped small pieces of lead. Even if the lead piping was removed years ago, the galvanized steel pipes could still periodically release the trapped lead into the water flow.


The only way to ensure that lead is not mobilized from plumbing to tap in a given home is to fully replace the galvanized plumbing and any lead service lines.

### What other problems can galvanized pipes cause?

### Low Water Pressure

Due to the restriction of the line, corrosion in galvanized pipes can cause lower water pressure throughout your home.


### Uneven Distribution of Water

If some of your taps have low water pressure but others don’t, this could be a symptom of galvanized pipes. Corrosion can build up unevenly. Also, part of the galvanized pipeline could have been replaced in your home but not everywhere.

### Discoloration of Water

Galvanized pipes can release iron and cause discoloration. A clear indicator of this is a brown stain on a porcelain sink.

### Leaks

Given enough time, galvanized pipes will rust through and cause more damage to your home.

### What does the galvanized piping removal process entail?

For a permanent fix, replacing all galvanized pipes is the best option, as it ensures all the rust and lead in the piping system is completely removed. While repiping an entire house is a big project, the payoffs are well worth the investment. The repiping process begins with an inspection to identify any unique problems that should be addressed. A replacement piping material is then selected, typically copper, PVC, or PEX for freshwater lines and ABS or PVC for waste and drain pipes.

After protecting your home from possible damage, qualified plumbers use specialized tools to locate existing pipes, remove them, and replace them with new ones.

Depending on your home’s size, a repiping project can take up to a week to complete. As pertaining to cost, the pipe material you choose and how much piping you need determines the final price. Older and vintage homes often have special considerations, such as plaster walls, that can result in the job taking longer and costing more.

![Commercial Water Line](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commercial-water-line.png)

Commercial water line repair will provide a steady supply of clean, fresh water that is essential essential for most offices and commercial spaces; from the taps that our employees wash their hands in, to the bathrooms that our clients and patrons use, to the hoses that our janitors use to clean our halls and spaces, we need it in our lives. A broken or damaged commercial water line fails to supply your space properly, and requires immediate attention by trusted professionals.

### When does a water line need repair?

Damaged water line signs and symptoms can be subtle or shocking. Less alarming symptoms include generally weaker water pressure from taps, and consistent clogging and drainage issues. These symptoms may be as a result of a pipe collapse and can escalate into floods and should not be ignored. More visible symptoms include consistently brown or otherwise discolored water, as a result of the pipes themselves aging or a breach that is allowing contaminants into the pipe.

No pipe is safe from possible wear, especially if they were not maintained properly, or installed incorrectly in the first place.

ABS or PVC pipes can crack due to high water temperatures, clay pipes can crack if they aren’t properly supported, cast iron pipes can corrode and rust, and any pipe can break due to the pressure from inside (water) and outside (the ground) the pipe.

What is the water line replacement procedure?



1. **Assessment**
Once the problem is assessed by our technician with a visual inspection and location, we provide you with a work plan.

2. **Planning and engineering**
Once the work plan is agreed on we pass it to our engineering team. Our engineers will provide the drawing, approve it with the municipality and obtain the permit for the project.

3. **Pipe replacement**
We expose the existing water line and replace it with the new one.

4. **Inspection**
Once the work is complete, our engineers and a city representative will inspect the newly installed connections.

5. **Water testing**
Water and chlorination tests are then performed.

6. **Permit closure and cleaning the area**
Once the inspector and the engineer pass the final inspection and close the permit, the line is back-filled with gravel and construction site is cleaned.

### Expert Sewer Line Repair for Burst, Leaking, Damaged and Tree Root Infested Pipes – Drain Master Plumbers

A blocked or backed-up sewer line can be a nightmare, especially when caused by tree roots infiltrating the pipes. While major root invasion may require professional assistance, introducing copper sulfate can prevent minor root problems from turning into major issues.



Sewer lines that are solid and sealed are less susceptible to tree roots, but even a small crack or fissure can allow roots to invade, grow, and cause significant damage.

The roots can collect solid waste, clogging the flow of water and leading to slow flushing and backups. As the roots continue to grow, they can also increase in length and width, completely blocking the sewer line.

At Drain Master Plumbers, we offer trenchless technology for sewer line repair, effectively destroying the damaged sewer line and replacing it with a new one, without the need for excavating your yard. Trust us to effectively and efficiently solve your tree root infestation problems.

### Understanding Sanitary Sewers – The Underground System for Transporting Sewage and Industrial Waste.

A sanitary sewer, also known as a foul sewer or covered sewer, is an underground system designed to transport sewage and industrial wastewater from homes and commercial buildings to treatment or disposal facilities. Unlike open sewers, the sanitary system is closed off to limit interaction between waste and the surrounding landscape.



![Water Lines](https://drainmastertrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/s7.webp)

The system of sewers is referred to as sewerage. Sanitary sewers are different from combined sewers, which also handle surface runoff. In the past, open sewers, consisting of gutters and urban streambeds, were commonly used worldwide. However, developed countries have made significant efforts to cover these open sewers and convert them to closed systems using materials such as cast iron, steel, or concrete pipes, masonry, and concrete arches. Today, open sewers are not used in developed countries, but they are still prevalent in many developing countries.

### Our Drain Cleaning Methods

At Drain Master, our plumbers are trained to utilize innovative methods to safely and effectively clear even the toughest drain clogs. Some of the methods we may use to resolve your home’s drainage issues include:

- **High-pressure water jetting**: Also known as hydro jetting, this process uses high-pressure water to clear clogged drains and sewer lines. It’s even powerful enough to break apart tree roots but won’t damage your pipes.
- **Drain & sewer rodding**: The power rodding system uses a flexible metal cable with a sharp cleaning head that threads into the drain system and around bends and joints. An electric motor then rotates the cable, obliterating obstructions in the pipe as it goes.
- **Camera inspections**: Our state-of-the-art sewer and drain cameras thoroughly inspect your plumbing lines to determine the cause of the clogs.

### The Vancouver Area’s Drain Cleaning Experts
